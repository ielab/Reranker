20201020-148,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20201020.pdf,Quantifying the effectiveness of cover crops to increase water infiltration and reduce evaporation in the northern region,The net water cost to grow cover crops is typically 40-60 mm. However  the additional cover protects soils in low cover fallows from erosion  and the rapid soil water recharge from the cover crop will maintain or even increase overall soil water accumulation for the next crop in 45-70% of years. Average net water benefits of 15-17 mm can be expected in these years for short and long fallows respectively.

A typical net water deficit of 40-60 mm can rapidly grow to 100+ mm and be hard to recover in all but very wet seasons when spray-out is delayed too long. Agronomic recommendations ï· Plant as soon as possible in the new fallow period to maximise the time available to recharge the soil water after the cover crops are removed.
20201020-7,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20201020.pdf,Quantifying the effectiveness of cover crops to increase water infiltration and reduce evaporation in the northern region,The best cover crop treatments recovered the 40-60 mm water deficit taken to grow them by the end of the fallow in most experiments  which modelling suggests may happen ~70% of years at Goondiwindi. While some cover crops stored up to 38mm extra plant available water  others lost water in some very dry seasons. It seems that cover crops can protect the soil from erosion in low cover fallows and maintain stored water in a majority of years.

The millet cover crop at Bungunya (Figure 3)  was planted on ~120 mm of Plant Available Water  used 50-60 mm more water than the control fallow through to late- termination but  had an overall fallow efficiency of 17% for the whole fallow compared to 14% for the bare fallow. This was due to its very high fallow efficiency (>70%) in the shorter period once the cover crop was sprayed out.

20201020-25,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20201020.pdf,Quantifying the effectiveness of cover crops to increase water infiltration and reduce evaporation in the northern region,Cover crops that produced 1 t/ha dry matter were predicted to reduce long-term erosion by 82%  2 t/ha by 96% and 3 t/ha by 99% at the Bungunya site.

There was no apparent additional value from multi-species cover crops with cereal providing the best results  so the subsequent decisions will be based on termination timings to suit short (early termination) or long (mid-termination) fallows.

20192023-41,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192023.pdf,Farming systems: Nitrogen dynamics and the impact of crop sequences over time,The Baseline received 20 kg N/ha and the Higher nutrient supply system received 80 kg N/ha in April 2017. Soil analysis the following year showed that 40 kg N/ha of N had mineralised and that this mineralised N and fertiliser N moved into the 10â30 and 30â60 cm layers during a very dry year. This data shows that if N is applied and not utilised by a crop  it is not likely to be lost from the system  but rather move down the profile to support future crop growth and grain production.

In contrast  low intensity systems provide more time to mineralise soil organic matter and accumulate nitrogen for each crop. Growers will have lower nitrogen fertiliser costs in the short- term  but depleting soil organic matter means the need for nitrogen fertiliser may only be delayed.

Nitrogen fertilisers can provide crop needs and reduce depletion of the underlying soil fertility.

Current varieties seem to be well adapted to late planting as there were no major differences in grain yield and all varieties took advantage of the supplementary irrigations. Foliar nitrogen does not give any advantage to late season planted chickpeas  although the application timings were targeted to the flowering stage of the crop and not the vegetative stage of the life cycle.

This trial was designed to develop more detailed data around the development of the chickpea plant in a late time of sowing (August) when it would be setting grain in a traditionally warmer and drier time of the year. The addition of in-crop irrigation and foliar nitrogen across several varieties will test whether the plant is more sensitive to water supply or temperature when it matures in warmer spring conditions.

The best performing irrigation treatments were achieving 3000 kg/ha which is 215 kg/ha less than the July TOS average (3215 kg/ha). The August TOS plots averaged 2153 kg/ha which is very similar to the dryland yield data from this trial which averaged 2223 kg/ha.

Implications for growers Potassium application has increased grain yields at these sites in previous years  however seasonal conditions in 2015-16 provided no responses to deep placement of K and/or P. When growing season conditions are favourable  as in the 2015/16 season  crops may be able to acquire more nutrient in the surface enriched layers.

Background As the length of time we have been cropping land increases  immobile nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are being taken up by plants from the soil in the 0.1-0.3 m layer. Return of crop residue is depositing potassium onto the surface.

At these yield levels there was no advantage in higher populations  in fact this trial would suggest that there was a yield advantage in low populations; but this is the only trial data that supports this and caution needs to be taken when considering these results.

Most of this data has been collected across low yielding dryland sites (0.5 to 1.2 t/ha). The main gap in this information is whether the non-response is the same in higher yielding situations (>1.5 t/ha).

Lack of in-crop rainfall during the flower and fruit set period would seem to be the main factor in reducing the yield of the later sowing time  although there may have been other weather factors (day length  vapour pressure deficit and temperature) that influenced dry matter production  canopy development and abortion of flowers. Soil moisture extraction data would indicate that less rainfall put pressure on the plant to extract more soil water in the later REGIONAL AGRONOMY NETWORK | 87 time of sowing particularly in the surface profile (0-60 cm) but less in the deeper zones (90-120 cm).

This may have also influenced the rate of canopy development. Light index measurements would indicate faster canopy development in the later sowing time but this was not associated with higher dry matter production.

This requires regular rainfall throughout the season to keep the soil wet  which is largely what happened in 2016 (see Trial details). The other advantage of winter rainfall is that the cooler temperatures reduce the level of evaporation so the surface soil stayed wetter for longer  which in turn increased the time that the surface roots of the plant have access to the P in the surface layers.
201608-21,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201608.pdf,Wheat: impact of population effect on phenology and yieldÃ¢ÂÂGoondiwindi,The time of sowing trial in the same district and the same season showed a decrease in yield  due to heat stress  of 100 kg /ha for each day that flowering was delayed after 25 September. A seven day delay in anthesis could have a large impact in yield on a later sown crop  however in this trial all plots reached 50% anthesis prior to 15 September  so heat stress was unlikely to have had an impact.

Slower developing genotypes in particular  where flowering coincided with significant heat and moisture stress conditions (from mid-July onwards)  suffered yield penalties. Whilst some slower spring genotypes such as SunmaxP and EaglehawkP  which have achieved comparable grain yields  although typically below average in previous seasons  this year they failed to achieve yields in excess of 0.3 t/ha  even in TOS 1.
20181903-18,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181903.pdf,Optimising the phenology and grain yield of wheat genotypesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Across environments of the northern grains region  the optimal flowering period is often defined by decreasing risk of frost  and increasing risk of moisture and heat stress. Generally  flowering date is a strong predictor of yield  with genotype and sowing date combinations that flower mid-late June at Emerald capable of achieving the highest grain yields. In 2018  the flowering window spanned 5ÃÂ June to 30 September  with significant variation in phasic duration and grain yield responses for genotype ÃÂ sowing date (Figure 2).
20181903-14,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181903.pdf,Optimising the phenology and grain yield of wheat genotypesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Results Phenology In wheat  flowering time is a critical determinant of grain yield potential. Across environments of the northern grains region  the optimal flowering period is often defined by decreasing risk of frost  and increasing risk of moisture and heat stress. Generally  flowering date is a strong predictor of yield  with genotype and sowing date combinations that flower mid-late June at Emerald capable of achieving the highest grain yields.
20181903-51,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181903.pdf,Optimising the phenology and grain yield of wheat genotypesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,This raises the question  do you wait for a late May plant to avoid the higher risk flowering period  and potentially take a yield penalty  or do you consider targeting the early May to late June window if the water is there to use? Despite the challenging seasonal conditions in 2018  some genotypes showed flexibility  and were able to achieve above average grain yields across a range of sowing dates. LongReach MustangP and newly released SunprimeP (TableÃÂ 4) were two of the stand-outs in 2018.
20181903-50,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181903.pdf,Optimising the phenology and grain yield of wheat genotypesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,This highlights the need to consider experimental results across a range of seasons. Whilst the Emerald site has a low frost risk  growers must consider their risk at both a paddock and farm level and varietal phenology responses when making sowing decisions. The vast majority of varieties in TOS 2 (April 20) and TOS 3 (May 5)  considered the traditional flowering times in CQ  were flowering in historically higher frost risk periods.

Implications for growers In 2015  the moderate nutrient supply strategy adopted in the Baseline system provided greater grain yields and profitability than the Higher nutrient supply system  because the Higher nutrient supply wheat crop used more water early in the season  grew more biomass  and flowered later  so then suffered from heat stress and terminal drought under a dry finish. Under the drier growing conditions of 2018  the extra nitrogen applied was not taken up by the crop  hence is still available for use by following crops.

Grain proteins were high for all wheat and durum plots (average 14.3% for wheat and 15.7% for durum)  so nitrogen had no impact on yield differences this season. The deep-planted chickpea had a patchy establishment with ~50% of the plot area not germinating across both systems.

The Baseline  Lower crop intensity (mixed)  Higher legume and Higher nutrient supply all have similar biomass  however the greatest amount of biomass was produced on the lowest-yielding system  Higher crop diversity  indicating that although the summer crops grew well in this system  they were not able to transfer this biomass to grain with high temperatures and low rainfall during anthesis and grain-fill. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 3000 6000 9000 12000 15000 18000 Baseline Lower crop intensity (Mixed) Lower crop intensity (Winter) Higher crop diversity Higher legume Higher nutrient supply Biom ass W U E (kg/m m ) Cr op b io m as s (k g/ ha ) kg/mm Figure 4.

However the Baseline and Higher nutrient supply plots had sparse patches which were not present in the Lower crop intensity (mixed) system. These patches had an impact on yield and water use efficiencies (WUE)  with Lower crop intensity (mixed) yielding 1.25 t/ha and a WUE of 11.1 kg/mm compared to a yield of 0.84 t/ha and WUE of 8.4 kg/mm for both the Baseline and Higher nutrient supply systems.

Three trials were established on the Western Downs over the 2015-16 summer (nine trials total in Queensland) to help increase local data on the efficacy and duration of control provided on ABYG and other associated broadleaf and grass weeds. This paper reports on one of the trials near Toobeah in southern Queensland.
20181901-2,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181901.pdf,Cereals research,The aims are to understand varietal differences in phenology both between the eight locations the trial was planted into in 2018  and between different sowing dates. The 2018 data was very different to what was observed in 2017  primarily due to a very dry winter season across the northern grains region  and there were significant reductions in both yield and biomass accumulation across all sowing dates. Quick maturing spring wheats had the highest yields for all four sowing dates in Central Queensland (CQ) while longer season varieties (traditionally favoured for early sowing dates) were significantly impacted  producing yields more than 1 t/ha lower  even for the earliest sowing date.
20181901-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181901.pdf,Cereals research,Unfortunately the flowering period for both early sowing treatments overshot our target window  however there was a notable difference in phenology response between the two sowing dates. Yield response for the earliest sowing date was up to 1 tonne/ha better and plant height was 10ÃÂ cm lower compared to the second sowing date. Screenings for both early sowing dates were high  but were better for the first sowing date  and there was an average of 10 days difference in time to flowering.

The slightly higher rainfall received earlier  post application  may have assisted BalanceÃÂ® 750 WG based treatments to activate at this site  and have had a reasonable effect on germinating seedlings. The clear message is that the combination of two different groups of herbicides has always performed better than any single product working on its own.
20181916-44,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181916.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,If this trend continues through the life of the trial it would suggest there is no financial difference between long-fallowing or taking double-crop opportunities to change between winter and summer crops. Pulse crops are not using water as efficiently as the cereal crops to produce biomass and grain at this site  however the higher value of these commodities means the gross margin return (and $/mm) are equal to the cereal dominated systems. Additionally  the high sodium content of the soil below 30 cm has meant pulse crops have left extra water behind at harvest  providing more opportunities to double-crop.
20181916-43,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181916.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,This is largely driven by the exceptionally high yielding cereal crops in the first two years of the trial reaching close to water unlimited yield potential. The summer crops for the same period experienced below average rainfall and temperatures in the hottest 10% of years  and so achieved lower grain yield  crop WUE and the gross margins in the Lower crop intensity and Higher crop intensity systems 84 | QUEENSLAND GRAINS RESEARCH 2018Ã¢ÂÂ19 in this period. These systems are performing quite similarly to each other for both total grain yield and gross margin  despite the Higher crop intensity system growing an extra three crops.
20181916-41,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181916.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,As such  these three systems have been the most profitable  with their only point of difference being a higher starter P fertiliser rate in the Higher nutrient supply and Higher soil fertility systems. The Higher legume and Higher crop diversity systems were both planted to pulses in winter 2016 that yielded less than the barley  but the higher value of faba bean and field pea meant their income was similar to the much higher yielding barley (Figure 2a  Figure 4). To date the Lower crop intensity system grew three crops  compared to six crops in the Higher crop intensity system  and achieved similar cumulative gross margins.
20181916-42,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181916.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,These two systems were in fallow for the highly profitable crop achieved by the other systems in winter 2016. As a result the Higher crop intensity and Lower crop intensity systems are providing the lowest economic returns to date  but have provided similar returns to the Baseline since 2016. Implications for growers Preliminary gross margin analysis (Figure 4) shows the Baseline to be the most profitable system to date.
20181916-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181916.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,Background Grain production in the Goondiwindi area is largely based on a winter cropping system with summer crops grown as a disease break. Most farms operate on a zero or minimum tillage system  with strong reliance on stored fallow moisture. Summer crops are seen as an important part of the system  however are often grown on a greater water profile than winter crops as an insurance against hot growing seasons with variable rainfall.
20181916-34,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181916.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,Crop water use efficiency (WUE  efficiency of converting stored PAW and in-crop rainfall to yield) and rainfall use efficiency (RUE  efficiency of converting rainfall to yield) followed the same trends for both dry matter production and grain yield for all of the systems (FigureÃÂ 2). WUE and RUE were highest for the highest- yielding crops. In six of the systems RUE was relative to the yield achieved  the exception being Higher crop intensity which was able to increase the proportion of rain used to grow biomass and grain with increased fallow efficiency.
20181916-14,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181916.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,Crops are fertilised (N and P) to achieve average yield potential for the PAW  with nitrogen only applied to the cereal crops. 5. Higher crop intensity aims to minimise the fallow periods within the system and potentially grow three crops every two years.
20181916-36,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181916.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,This has also meant the Higher legume system has grown the same number of crops as the Higher crop intensity system (six)  despite having the same moderate planting water triggers as the Baseline system  which has grown two less crops. ( a) (b) REGIONAL RESEARCH AGRONOMY | 83 The days in fallow versus in-crop varies dramatically between systems  with the Lower crop intensity system having the largest number (903 days) versus the Higher crop intensity system with the smallest (613 days) number of fallow days. The moderate crop intensity Baseline system was similar to the Higher crop intensity system at 630 days in fallow.
20181916-35,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181916.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,Conversely WUE favoured the Lower crop intensity system (relative to yield) with this system able to more efficiently convert the extra stored PAW to yield. Higher legume and Higher crop diversity had the lowest WUE relative to yield  due to these systems growing more canola and pulse crops. All of the pulse crops to date have had significant amounts of PAW left deep in the profile at harvest  which has led to double crop opportunities after every pulse crop grown at this site (Figure 1).

There were a number of sites where other constraints  particularly N and K deficiencies  have limited P responses in CQ.

As noted above  K and S were applied to eliminate other nutrient deficiencies where required and to ensure measured responses were to P. Whilst some sites have shown positive responses to K  especially in CQ chickpea crops  no sites have responded to S. If K levels are also low  applying a blanket rate of 50 kg/ha would add ~$50/ha to the total treatment cost. N costs could be reduced if P was applied into a high N environment.

Implications for growers So far this experiment has demonstrated that alternative crops like canola and durum wheat can have a positive impact on both nematode populations  subsequent grain yields without large negative impacts on system water or nitrogen use efficiency. The impact of nematodes on reducing the grain yield of mungbean and propagating their populations demonstrates that double crops or two susceptible crops is high risk and should be avoided where nematode populations are significant.
201645-30,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201645.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂPampas,Generally the systems with a higher NUE were those with a more negative N balance; only the three systems with NUE below the baseline system are those with higher relative N balance.

This  and the impact on subsequent crop yields  should be taken into account when assessing double crop options in the farming system. Our systems have also demonstrated some of the complications with some systems such as managing residual herbicides and volunteer crops as weeds in subsequent crops (e.g. field pea).

Residual herbicides can provide important alternatives to knockdown herbicides such as glyphosate. These trials indicate that combining herbicides with different modes of action can provide better and more consistent control of broadleaf and grass weeds than herbicides applied individually.

Similarly  when T3 FlameÃÂ® (Group B)  which is registered to control grass weeds  is combined with herbicides of other modes of action  for example T16  T14  T19  T11  better results can be achieved on a wider range of weeds. T6 (Group D)  T4 TerbyneÃÂ® XtremeÃÂ®875 (Group C)  T9 ValorÃÂ® (Group G) and T8 Group K have also been shown to provide better control when combined with herbicides with other modes of action.

The use of residual fallow herbicides can play an important role in an integrated weed management program. Growers must consider the plant back period when using residual herbicides.

This research will improve our understanding in regards to the effect of sowing date on time to flowering  allowing us to better target the flowering window between mid-September and mid-October in CQ.

20181902-3,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181902.pdf,Early planting sorghumÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Background Water stress and extreme heat at flowering are common abiotic stresses limiting yield in cereal crop production across the northern grains region. Early sown sorghum crops in Central Queensland (CQ) have shown high yield potentials  but with an increase in perceived risk due to water/heat stress at flowering or frost damage at emergence. The Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) research project  Optimising Sorghum Agronomy (UOQ 1808-001RTX)  led by the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation (QAAFI) in partnership with the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) and New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (DPI NSW)  looks to challenge these perceptions.

However  targeting the optimum flowering period remains the primary objective  no matter which variety is selected. Background In 2019  field experiments were conducted across ten sites in the northern grains region to determine the influence of phenology on grain yield responses for a diverse set of wheat genotypes.
20192003-34,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192003.pdf,Wheat: Phenology and yield response to sowing timeÃ¢ÂÂPampas,However  this was in a low water stress environment  so such big differences would be less likely in a more typical dryland scenario. Importantly  the low water stress environment means the days to flowering observed in this trial may also be longer than what would typically be expected under traditional dryland conditions. The targeted optimum flowering period for a location should stay relatively consistent to minimise the risk of stress on the flowering/ early grain fill plants.
20192003-35,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192003.pdf,Wheat: Phenology and yield response to sowing timeÃ¢ÂÂPampas,The challenge is in selecting the correct maturity  which will flower within this period from year to year when variables like plant available water  sowing date and environment can vary significantly. Those agronomic influences will also influence plant stress  which in turn can significantly speed up or (in this trial's case) slow down the duration of time from sowing date to flowering. While we can estimate an approximate days to flowering for the varieties trialled over the longer term at some locations  this confidence will diminish for locations with a different climate or soil type  or with brand new genotypes.

Run-off and soil loss from rainfall is higher on near full profiles in a long fallow  along with increased opportunity to control weeds in fallow with non-selective herbicides.

Whether this pattern of response is particular to the mungbean species or more relatable to the level of stratification for each nutrient and the in-crop rainfall for the season is still difficult to determine. However  this trial's plant analyses have highlighted that a mungbean crop does have a high requirement for K in view of the plant analysis data.

There are a number of data sets that demonstrate chickpeas can respond to deep placement of both P and K in CQ soils  however the amount of data recorded on mungbeans is limited.
20181909-41,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181909.pdf,Responses to deep placement of phosphorus and potassium in mungbeansÃ¢ÂÂDululu,The 2018 mungbean crop has shown a more consistent response to the deep-applied K than chickpea  however the chickpeas were also clearly responsive to P bands at the same time as demonstrated by the change in yield response when the background P was removed from the treatment (100K -PS and 0K Ã¢ÂÂPS) (Figure 5). Plant analysis can confirm that the mungbean crop was accessing the deep-applied K bands (Figure 6). The plant analysis data shows that both the chickpeas (2017) and the mungbeans (2018) had similar patterns of uptake when comparing the 0K treatment and all other treatments that contained K. An interesting point in this comparison is the concentration of K in dry matter (DM) is higher in the mungbeans than in chickpeas and subsequently total K uptake (kg/ha) is also higher in mungbeans.
20181909-47,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181909.pdf,Responses to deep placement of phosphorus and potassium in mungbeansÃ¢ÂÂDululu,Soil analysis taken at the planting of the 2018 mungbean crop (Table 6) shows a similar pattern of stratification to the P soil tests (Table 4) although not quite as dramatic. Surface levels could be termed as adequate to marginal (>0.2) with the subsurface levels then dropping down to deficient levels (<0.15) (Table 6). While both nutrients in each trial have deficient levels in the subsurface layer  for reasons unknown at this stage  the mungbean crop has only responded to the K nutrient in these deep-placement bands.

20181909-56,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181909.pdf,Responses to deep placement of phosphorus and potassium in mungbeansÃ¢ÂÂDululu,Further trial data will be required to ascertain the true characteristics of mungbean interaction with deep-placed P and K. Despite the moderate yields produced in the mungbean crop in 2018 the ROI for both nutrients are positive and approaching up to two times the cost of deep placement. Future crops will boost this ROI further and will dictate which rate of nutrition will be the most economical. Acknowledgements Thanks to the trial co-operators for hosting these trials.

This was demonstrated across these three trials. Under hot conditions (as experienced in Emerald) the disease did not reach severe levels of infection and as a result no significant differences in either powdery mildew severity or grain yield were measured between treatments.

This site had 300 kg N/ha available at the time of planting wheat in 2015 and has needed no nitrogen fertiliser to grow the 11 t/ha of cereals to date. Post-harvest soil tests indicate these cereal systems had 50 kg N/ha remaining (November 2016)  whereas the two systems that 162 | QUEENSLAND GRAINS RESEARCH Ã¢ÂÂ 2016 had a pulse crop in 2016 had 100 kg N/ha left.
201643-52,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201643.pdf,Northern Farming Systems siteÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,Combined with the extra PAW remaining after the pulse crops  there is opportunity to reduce the gap in system profitability with the next crop grown. The comparison between the Lower Crop Intensity and Higher Crop Intensity systems is also worth noting. The mungbean grown in the Higher Crop Intensity system was low yielding but still covered costs  while the Lower Crop Intensity system had the cost of fallow sprays with no income.

With only 50 kg N/ha difference between the systems at this point there was only a small difference in biomass production and protein levels in the feed were the same. Another 50 kg N/ha was applied in front of the next rainfall event.

As can be seen in Table 1  the Higher legume system rotation has been chickpea  wheat and chickpea  over the past three years  where four of the others have been wheat  chickpea  wheat. Higher intensity had an additional light crop of mungbean in 2016  however it is still the second lowest in average grain yield.

For WUE relative to biomass produced  the Higher soil fertility system just managed to edge out the IWM treatment  despite the difference in row spacing (50 cm versus 25 cm).
20171823-29,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171823.pdf,Northern Farming SystemsÃ¢ÂÂEmerald regional site,Yields averaged 1.95 t/ha for both the wheat and chickpea treatments. Biomass and grain yield production did vary between treatments (Figure 1) with the Higher fertility system again out-yielding the other treatments. Grain qualities across all treatments this year were very good  despite the hard season  with wheat proteins averaging 13.1%.

This means in a dryland scenario a later TOS has a far more reliable yield as it can produce more grain for the same amount of stored moisture.
20181905-59,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181905.pdf,Interactions of mungbean physiology in relation to timing of rainfall and time of sowingÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,For an irrigator  an earlier planting window can produce more yield as long as evaporative demand can be met without waterlogging the plant. This contrast in the plant may well be a direct attribute of the plantÃ¢ÂÂs tap root structure which has a low surface area. When evaporative conditions are high  the root system cannot supply enough water fast enough for the plant to maintain full turgor pressure in its cells and therefore transitions into stress mode.
20181905-60,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181905.pdf,Interactions of mungbean physiology in relation to timing of rainfall and time of sowingÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,It is possible that the plant is stressing before visual symptoms are apparent and consequently normal biomass production is constantly being interrupted. Based on these findings it would be expected that mungbeans would be more suited to situations where evaporative pressure is lower (lower temperature and/or higher humidity); which means planting later (February-March) in the summer for CQ regions.

The addition of FlameÃÂ®  Group D  BalanceÃÂ® or GroupÃÂ K to the broadleaf active herbicides (GroupÃÂ Cs and ValorÃÂ®) often improved their efficacy on sowthistle  but more importantly will improve control of the grass weeds common in the northern grains region.

20171829-39,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171829.pdf,Efficacy of residual herbicideÃ¢ÂÂWestern Downs,The trials reported here demonstrated that these products can perform quite poorly on the broadleaf weed sowthistle  when applied alone. The most effective products for sowthistle in these trials were ValorÃÂ® and the two Group C products  but are limited by their shorter residual active life and  Group C in particular  can be quite weak in controlling grasses (ValorÃÂ® was not included in the 2016 trials). In 'Queensland Grains ResearchÃ¢ÂÂ2016'  there was a consistent benefit in grass weed control from mixing two products with different modes of action.

20171814-50,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171814.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied potassium in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,At both sites it is apparent that K is not the most limiting nutrient and therefore response to deep K will be limited unless the deficiency in the most limiting nutrient (in this case P) has been overcome. To summarise  most of these variables relate to the plants' requirement and ability to take up nutrient. Where the plants are taking water from in the profile  the size of the root system and its structure and the critical timing of when plants are setting up yield all play a role in determining the effective acquisition of nutrients.
20171814-47,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171814.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied potassium in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,The surface soil would have been dry for most of the crop's life so access to any of the surface nutrient would also have been limited. Whilst not statistically significant  the trend for a K response in 2017 but not one to deep P was interesting. Diffusive supply of P through soil to plant roots is much less efficient than that of K  so to effectively exploit a deep P band there would need to be more roots around that concentrated P source than there would be to see significant K uptake from a deep K band.
20171814-49,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171814.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied potassium in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,Yield responses can vary significantly at the same site for the same treatment across two different seasons  due to differences in seasonal patterns of rainfall and root access to different profile layers. It is imperative that growers understand these variables and to what extent they can influence results. Crop species  in-crop rainfall and starting soil nutrients can all have a large influence on the scale of response to deep-banded nutrients.
20171814-46,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171814.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied potassium in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,Secondary root development was very limited; most plants had to survive on a primary root system  meaning that the crop did not have the capacity to develop a root system of sufficient size or surface area. This would have seriously limited the ability to effectively exploit deep soil moisture or nutrients  and also would have had limited ability to proliferate roots in and around deep bands to effectively take advantage of the nutrients in them.
20171814-34,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171814.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied potassium in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,During this period the surface soil would have been largely dry as the last in-crop rainfall was 40 days earlier  and so nutrient reserves in the 0-10 cm layer would have been largely inaccessible. This meant that the crop was accessing moisture from deeper in the profile during the critical flowering period and therefore would have been relying on deep P and K bands in otherwise depleted subsoil layers to acquire the nutrients needed to set yield potential. Comet River The Comet River site was planted to wheat in the 2017 winter season and experienced very tough conditions.
20171814-30,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171814.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied potassium in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,The site K status (Table 7) shows marginal K availability in the 0-10 cm layer for a soil with a moderate CEC of 22 cmol/kg  but exchangeable K that is effectively half what we are currently estimating as the critical exchangeable K for crop responses in the 10-30 cm layer  and that declines further in the 30-60 cm layer. This stratification of nutrients can interact with seasonal constraints to affect plant response to deep-banded nutrients. In other words  this looks to be a site where the less access the roots have to the top 10 cm (e.g. in seasons with infrequent in-crop rainfall events)  the worse the crop K status is likely to be.

Further collection of data from this site will help clarify the relative P and K limitations at this site and soil type. Implications for growers The results from the two deep-banded K trials over the last two years demonstrates the variability that can occur in the responses to deep placed nutrients.

However this was not the same for P concentration as there were no significant differences between the P treatments and the control plots (Figure 2). The deep applied P and K bands were placed together in the soil profile so if the roots had access to the applied K it should also have access to the applied P. The plant tissue analysis (Figures 2 and 3) would suggest that this has not happened  although there are differences in how plants respond to a supply of P and K that exceeds crop requirements.

However  the conversion of biomass responses into yield responses was more consistent in Central Queensland in similar tough seasonal conditions (see Clermont trial report  page 45)  suggesting there is more to this than a Ã¢ÂÂhaying offÃ¢ÂÂ response. For the cereal experiments  both starter and deep-P treatments were independently highly significant on grain yield (Table 2). Neither site has recorded an interaction between starter and deep-placed P. The grain yields for both experiments clearly demonstrate the potential contribution each can make to increasing yield with the plus starter treatments greater than the minus starter across the range of deep-placed P rates (Figures 3 and 4).

In 2019 the four original P treatments (0  10  20 and 40 kg P/ha) had their plots split and 30 kg P/ha applied in 50 cm bands at a depth of 25 cm with a YeomansÃÂ® deep ripper implement (Table 1). The band spacing for the reapplication was the same as the original treatments carried out in 2013.

The size of the response to deep-applied P is not always just about the rate of P applied. Seasonal influences such as in-crop rainfall (amount and timing)  soil type (water holding capacity) and the status of other nutrients in the soil profile will all have significant impacts on the response to deep-applied P and K. The response to K at this site was overshadowed by the massive response to P. However over six years  the grain response was 1.2 t/ha over and above the response to P. There has been no real difference between the 100 kg K/ha and 50 kg K/ha treatments.

The main treatments in this experiment focused on reducing vegetative growth prior to flowering in order to save on stored soil moisture. The treatments did reduce vegetative mass at flowering but in the most part did not reduce the final dry matter weight at maturity for either the April or May TOS.

Applying BroadstrikeÃ¢ÂÂ¢ at 28DAS had a bigger impact in the early TOS but much less impact in the later TOS.

Another way of looking at this effect is that the April TOS had the largest dry matter accumulation and therefore needed the most amount of water to maintain its growth  hence the rainfed treatments ran out of water a lot sooner and the added irrigation had the greatest effect. The yield advantage maintained by the May TOS over both the earlier and later TOSs may primarily be due to the best balance between minimum dry matter and maximum grain yield.

For the April TOS (Figure 2 (a) and (b))  the slashing treatment at 42DAS was the most significant reduction compared to the controls and this was consistent at flowering and at maturity in both row spacings. The full BS application had the biggest effect on DM at flowering in the 75 cm rows.

The June TOS (Figure 10 (b)) pattern was similar  with both BS treatments applied 28DAS having significantly lower yields than both the slashing and the control treatments. The main difference between the May TOS and the June TOS was in the 42DAS applications  with all three biomass reduction treatments causing a significant decline in grain yield against the controls.

All the 50ÃÂ cm row treatments yielded significantly less than their 75 cm counterparts except the control plots and there was no significant differences in the 75 cm row treatments compared to their own control plots.

This experiment has shown that the chickpea plant can optimise dry matter production to produce an excellent HI from stored moisture in an ideal planting window. What remains is how we can manage the plant in an early TOS scenario to replicate what the plant naturally does in an ideal planting window.

This trial site has given some evidence that robust applications of immobile nutrients like P and K  in addition to slightly more mobile nutrients like S  can continue to provide yield responses for up to five years. However  ensuring adequate N is available on a year-by year basis is essential to achieve these responses.

To counteract poor nodulation  a proportion of the industry have decided that itÃ¢ÂÂs easier and more efficient to apply N in order to maximise yield. As mungbeans are a very short duration crop  some consider that even with good nodulation  the fixation process is too slow to supply the required amount of N to maximise yield.

Anecdotal evidence from industry is that mungbean yields increase in response to higher nitrate levels in the profile when N is applied in the fallow. This begs the question  what is it about N applied early in the fallow that improves mungbean yield over those with N applied at planting?

Based on the soil analysis this not surprising  as the soil test would indicate the response to K should be negligible. In this scenario when evaluating how much fertiliser to put down in a deep application  the trial data indicates there is far more benefit in just applying P at the highest rate possible. The trial data would suggest that as the highest rate of P (40 kg P/ha) gave the highest grain production  there may have been even greater yield responses if higher P rates had been tested.

Further investigation of this observation was of particular interest given this type of scenario often occurs in Central Queensland (CQ) when wheat is deep planted early in the winter season and plant establishment can be lower as a result. What was done Five wheat varieties were tested for their response to a range of plant populations  row spacings and time of sowings.

This result is consistent across a wide range of starting soil N conditions  from very high to low mineral N status where legumes would be required to fix N to meet their needs. These results significantly challenge the commonly held assumption that grain legumes will reduce N fertiliser needs in the crop sequence.

Field peas 2016 at Billa Billa. 94 | QUEENSLAND GRAINS RESEARCH 2018Ã¢ÂÂ19 Implications for growers Overall these results indicate that across our farming system sites the implementation of additional legume crops in the crop sequence has not reduced N fertiliser input needs nor reduced soil N use.

20181918-34,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181918.pdf,The impact different farming systems have on soil nitrogen  phosphorus and potassiumÃ¢ÂÂNorthern Region,As our capacity to grow high- yielding grain legumes has increased  so too has our harvest index and hence the ratio of N removed in grain to that left in biomass  thereby diminishing the contributions of residual N after the crop. Phosphorous export was variable across sites  so no conclusions have been drawn regarding P  however the Higher legume system did increase the amount of potassium exported across all sites relative to BaselineÃ¢ÂÂalthough this is not unexpected as legume seed has more than double the K content than cereal grains. In situations where K deficiency may be an emerging issue or where levels are marginal  this greater export under a Higher legume system may mean that nutrients will need to be replaced sooner or a higher level of replacement will be required.
20181918-37,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181918.pdf,The impact different farming systems have on soil nitrogen  phosphorus and potassiumÃ¢ÂÂNorthern Region,The first four years of the farming system project showed that modifying crop systems through higher nutrients did balance the net export of nutrients (N  P) relative to the inputs in several cases. However  there have been few cases where we have seen a positive yield advantage from providing these additional nutrients. This may change as soils age and their inherent fertility declines.

These can take affect as early as late July to early August. Wellcamp has a much more defined temperature threshold window because of the significant frost risk and then the quick transition to +30ÃÂ°C in spring.

In central Queensland (CQ)  this response is commonly driven by the high risk of heat and moisture stress  whilst in southern Queensland (SQ) there is an increased risk associated with early frost damage.

The cumulative increases in grain yield  particularly for wheat in these experiments suggests deep-placing phosphorus can boost yield despite contrasting seasonal conditions (Table 6). Increased cereal grain yield however will also have implications for nitrogen management  with higher yields requiring a greater nitrogen supply to meet water limited potential.

Only Green DiamondP and Jade-AUP have a slightly higher rating of 'moderately susceptible'. Plant resistance and the application of foliar fungicides are the only two viable options available for the management of powdery mildew in mungbeans.

Recent diagnostic research has estimated that this costs the Queensland grains industry approximately $147M annually in lost potential. Indeed  sodicity appears to be the key constraint in the majority of fields assessed as it compromises soil structure  decreases rainwater intake  soil water availability and nutrient acquisition  and impairs biological (soil microbial and plant root) activity.

LongReach SpitfireP will outperform SuntopP in lower N and lower starting water situations  however limiting available N for given moisture will also limit yield potential of both varieties.
201616-19,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201616.pdf,Wheat: how does starting water and nitrogen impact across different varietiesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Interestingly we saw high variability in yield and WUE in the low water scenario  between treatments for SuntopP when compared to LongReach SpitfireP  however this was completely reversed in the high water scenario  where SuntopP showed considerably less variability than LongReach SpitfireP. Implications for growers SuntopP and LongReach SpitfireP have been recognised for some time for displaying very different characteristics for accumulating yield and protein. These differences have been consistent across the northern region. This was particularly so in the higher starting water scenario where SuntopP consistently out-yielded LongReach SpitfireP however  WUE was reduced.
201616-13,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201616.pdf,Wheat: how does starting water and nitrogen impact across different varietiesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,These population differences have been consistent across multiple trials in 2015 and 2016  indicating that LongReach SpitfireP may inherently have more vigour than SuntopP. LongReach SpitfireP and SuntopP are recognised as having similar maturities and this held true with flowering observations. There were no significant differences (p=0.05) observed between flowering dates of the two varieties  nor was there a significant difference observed between N treatments  averaging around 78 days after planting. The SuntopP was a slightly taller plant at grain fill (Figure 1)  and with plenty of N available to it in the 100% YP treatments  seemed to have a greater capacity to maximise yield  compared to the shorter LongReach SpitfireP. Changing starting PAW or N rates has not had an impact on plant height in this trial.

201606-17,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201606.pdf,Wheat: the effects of different planting dates on yield and plant physiology across different varietiesÃ¢ÂÂWarwick,While the average of all varieties tested suggest there is no yield difference for planting date in this climate  varieties do need to be selected for their most appropriate planting window in order to maximise yield potential. Reference guides such as the Queensland Wheat Varieties Guide are a good source of information for deciding the best planting window for individual varieties. 24 | QUEENSLAND GRAINS RESEARCH Ã¢ÂÂ 2016 Acknowledgements The Variety Specific Agronomy Packages (VSAP) program is co-funded by the Grains Research and Development Corporation  New South Wales Department of Primary Industries and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.
201606-16,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201606.pdf,Wheat: the effects of different planting dates on yield and plant physiology across different varietiesÃ¢ÂÂWarwick,Implications for growers Four of the five varieties that measured significant yield reductions for later planting date were all slower maturing varieties that had reduced days to anthesis for each of the three TOS. This could be attributed to the warming temperatures later in the season accelerating development and therefore reducing yield. While only one variety suffered yield reduction as a result of frost in this trial  the Australian CliMate model shows there is a high likelihood of frost for early flowering crops in this area.

201607-25,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201607.pdf,Wheat: impact of population and row spacing effect on the phenology and yield potentialÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,It is harder to establish higher populations on wider rows. Figure 1 shows the average plant establishment of all varieties in the wider row spacing configuration (50 cm) was significantly lower than it was in the narrower spacing (25 cm) for the same targeted plant populations. Growers should consider this difference when setting seeding rates to maximise yield.
201607-11,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201607.pdf,Wheat: impact of population and row spacing effect on the phenology and yield potentialÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Harvest took place on 10 October 2016 and all grain was weighed and tested for moisture  protein  screenings  test weights and seed size. Results Establishment Significant differences were measured in plant establishment for most of the population x row spacing configurations  with  only the 50 cm 900 000 target population and the 25 cm 600 000 target population treatments not significantly different from each other (Table 2). The average difference in established plants between the wide row configurations and narrow row configurations was 75%.
201607-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201607.pdf,Wheat: impact of population and row spacing effect on the phenology and yield potentialÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,In 2015  the initial Variety Specific Agronomy Packages (VSAP) trial in CQ explored the relationships between different wheat varieties  time of sowing and plant population on yield. It was planted on 50 cm row spacing  in line with current grower practice within the region. Results showed that the average yield across varieties for the mid-April time of sowing (TOS) plant was 4.1 t/ha and for the mid-May plant 3.3 t/ha.
201607-4,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201607.pdf,Wheat: impact of population and row spacing effect on the phenology and yield potentialÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,50 cm row spacing may not be as detrimental to yield potential as previously thought. Background Previous research on optimum plant populations in Queensland and New South Wales has consistently indicated an established population of 1 million plants per hectare is optimum for maximising yield. In addition  research conducted in Central Queensland (CQ) from 2002Ã¢ÂÂ2004 by Spackman  Reid  et al.1 concluded that Ã¢ÂÂWhen yield exceeds 2.5 t/ha  yield loss of 0.3Ã¢ÂÂ0.5 t/ha is likely with rows wider than 25 cm and the yield loss is likely to be higher in 50 cm than 37.5 cm rows.Ã¢ÂÂ
201613-26,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201613.pdf,Wheat: impact of varying nitrogen treatments across different varieties and maturitiesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Trying to match nitrogen rates at the start of the season is always a challenge  particularly if the profile is not full or you are reliant on in-crop rain to get through the season. For this particular trial  the only variety that showed a significant yield increase as a result of nitrogen application was SuntopP  which would indicate that if planting into a high N site  it may be the preferred variety to maximise yield  however that yield response could come at a varietal protein penalty when compared to similar maturity varieties. Table 3.
201613-18,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201613.pdf,Wheat: impact of varying nitrogen treatments across different varieties and maturitiesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Average plants established after 10 days  across all treatments  excluding 150% YP Bars with different letters are significantly different (P<0.05) REGIONAL AGRONOMY NETWORK | 47 There was a significant difference in protein as N rates increased across varieties. LongReach SpitfireP again showed its ability to produce a higher protein grain than the similar maturity SuntopP (Figure 3)  however when you look at other attributes such as screenings  test weight and 1000 seed weight (Table 2)  there wasnÃ¢ÂÂt a great difference between them in 2016. EGA GregoryP had the widest protein response of any of the varieties  however its yield response was almost flat  when compared to SuntopP or LongReach SpitfireP (Figure 3).
201613-24,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201613.pdf,Wheat: impact of varying nitrogen treatments across different varieties and maturitiesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Suntop) Figure 3. Yield and protein response to nitrogen treatments applied to SuntopP  LongReach SpitfireP and EGA GregoryP The yield response from LongReach SpitfireP  LongReach LancerP and LongReach GauntletP were almost identical with all three varieties appearing to decrease yield as protein increased (Figure 4). This would indicate sufficient N was available for the given water available to the crop for these varieties  however there were statistical differences in yield performance between the three (Table 3).
201613-3,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201613.pdf,Wheat: impact of varying nitrogen treatments across different varieties and maturitiesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,SuntopP was the only variety to provide a positive yield response to nitrogen treatments in a high starting nitrogen scenario  however there were significant yield differences between varieties. 3. Application of excessive nitrogen for the amount of water available can give a yield penalty.
201602-21,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201602.pdf,Maize: measuring the effect on yield  quality and plant structure when manipulating hybrid variety  population and row spacingÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,So despite planting on a reasonable to good profile of moisture with an excellent establishment  the crop failed to achieve the yields that the sorghum agronomy trial (page 7) achieved planted under almost identical conditions. It is known that maize is more sensitive to stresses than sorghum  particularly around the critical stages for grain number determination at flowering  and this season was a perfect example of that. Manipulating planting time to ensure time of flowering and grain fill occurs during a wetter or cooler flowering period may play a role in optimising production.
201639-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201639.pdf,Soils research,The main findings across these projects to date include: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Long-term cropping across Queensland and New South Wales continues to deplete soil organic carbon levels. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ These changes in soil carbon appear to be driven by the lengthy fallow periods in current cropping systems. Ã¢ÂÂ¢
201639-6,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201639.pdf,Soils research,The resulting decline in available nutrient reserves (typically nitrogen) leads to increased use of fertiliser  extra costs and the reduced profitability of grain cropping over time. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Productive pasture phases are the Ã¢ÂÂstand-outÃ¢ÂÂ option to improve total soil organic carbon levels in mixed farming systems. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Soil phosphorus levels on many of the degraded long-term cropping soils are very low.
201617-3,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201617.pdf,Pulse agronomy research,The 2016 mungbean trials in CQ showed a yield response to narrow rows (25 cm and 50 cm) but only when yield expectations were above 1.5 t/ha. Plant population trials demonstrated no yield response to populations between 15 plants/mÃÂ² to 35 plants/mÃÂ² but a significant reduction in yield when populations were below 15 plants/mÃÂ² in both mungbeans and chickpeas. Time of sowing trials showed mungbeans are not always vegetatively determinate at flowering depending on soil water conditions.

Boiling proved more effective than autoclaving for reducing the levels of antinutrients and improving the protein quality of the beans  as shown by the higher values for weight gain  protein efficiency ratio (PER)  net protein ratio (NPR) and true digestibility (TD) of boiled samples. There were no significant (p > 0.05) differences between the values obtained for PER  NPR and TD of diets containing boiled samples of TGx 923 2EN and casein  indicating the nutritional superiority of this soybean line compared with TGx 1019 2EN and TGx 1497 1D. # 2002 Society of Chemical Industry Keywords: chemical composition;

The weight gains of rats fed diets containing boiled soybeans were significantly higher than those of rats fed diets containing autoclaved beans. Improvements in the growth of rats fed boiled legumes have been reported.24 31 32 The values obtained for PER  NPR and TD of diets containing boiled samples of TGx 923-2EN were similar to those of the casein control diet  indicating that this new soybean line is nutritionally superior to TGx 1019-4.2EN and TGx 1497-1D. In conclusion  this study has shown that TGx 9231738 2EN has desirable attributes such as high crude protein  low levels of antinutrients and superior nutritional quality compared with TGx 1019-2EN and TGx 1497-1D. This soybean line could possibly be further improved by breeders to have other desirable cooking characteristics  such as reduced cooking times and higher levels of water absorption during soaking.

However  overapplication of P at 117 kg haÃ¢Ëâ1 decreased SOC possibly due to rapid microbial respiration under increased P availability  indicating that overapplication of P is not supportive of C sequestration in soil. Soil organic C or N did not respond to P fertilization on medium soil at Milan since grain P removal was four times higher than that at Springfield  higher initial P fertility and greater P sorption capacity of Milan soil might have led to slower increase in soil P. The absence of a significant positive regression between SOC and N and crop residue biomass implies that warm and humid climatic conditions of the Mid-south favors residue decomposition over accumulation resulting in rapid decomposition of SOC at 0 to 5 cm  which can minimize the overall SOC improvement for single layer soil sample collected from 0 to 15 cm.

This variety is the first to include significant levels of stress tolerance with resistance to powdery mildew  viruses (pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV) and BLRV)  tolerance to high soil B and moderate tolerance to salinity. These trait combinations give it good yield stability and it outclasses Kaspa by an average of 12% Australia-wide.

This was probably due to these systems providing more time or an improved environment for stubble breakdown. High N input continuous wheat systems led to the largest increase in CR inoculum and highlights why this rotation is actively discouraged  especially in environments where stubble breakdown is slow.

All these sequences  except wheat/long fallow/cotton  were duplicated under high nutrition inputs (*)  mainly high nitrogen (N) in cereals.

RLNs have a wide host range; the main crops used in the region host P. thornei  hence their populations have increased in the absence of profitable non-host (break) crops.

The Higher crop intensity and wheat/long fallow/ sorghum systems led to modest increases while the continuous wheat system gave the biggest increase in CRR inoculum (Fig. 2d).
20181919-7,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181919.pdf,Impact of crop species and crop sequencing on nematode  crown rot and common root rot inoculum loadsâNorthern Region,Common root rot  hosted by winter cereals  is most severe in wheat and barley. Good resistance exists in wheat cultivars but barley cultivars vary widely in susceptibility. Using crops resistant to these diseases with greater regularity in crop rotations  is one way to mitigate yield reduction.

After harvest the wheat accumulated an extra 14 mm PAW; the two systems then had the same PAW again when the winter-only systems were planted.

This demonstrates that while WUE is a useful benchmark  there is large season to season variability due to the timing of rainfall events and other stresses that reduce crop yields. These seasonal differences for in-crop rainfall mean there was no clear relationship between planting soil water and crop yield across this data  but there was an interesting relationship between available soil water at planting for the crop and the 'marginal' WUE that that crop achieved (Figure 6  middle row).

The required N to maximise pasture production can be supplied to the system by the inclusion of a legume in the pasture mix or by the addition of N fertiliser. Fertilising pasture with N (as opposed to establishing a legume/grass mix) will be quicker and more effective at increasing SOC in the short-term  and may better fit a grain farming system.

The average total organic carbon (TOC) levels at the beginning of the trial were extremely low (0.22% 0â10 cm and 0.12% 10â30 cm) reflecting the impact that long-term cropping has on SOC levels on lighter soil types. However  these lighter soils are expected to respond more rapidly to the additional biomass produced by a productive pasture.

Phosphorous export was variable across sites  so no conclusions have been drawn regarding P  however the Higher legume system did increase the amount of potassium exported across all sites relative to Baselineâalthough this is not unexpected as legume seed has more than double the K content than cereal grains. In situations where K deficiency may be an emerging issue or where levels are marginal  this greater export under a Higher legume system may mean that nutrients will need to be replaced sooner or a higher level of replacement will be required.

Field peas 2016 at Billa Billa. 94 | QUEENSLAND GRAINS RESEARCH 2018â19 Implications for growers Overall these results indicate that across our farming system sites the implementation of additional legume crops in the crop sequence has not reduced N fertiliser input needs nor reduced soil N use.

20181918-12,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181918.pdf,The impact different farming systems have on soil nitrogen  phosphorus and potassiumâNorthern Region,Some sites (e.g. Emerald) did reduce the required N fertiliser (by 83 kg N/ha). At other sites  such as Trangie (grey soil) and Pampas  the Higher legume system increased N fertiliser required in subsequent crops by 25 kg N/ha compared to the local Baseline system. These findings can be explained by the Higher legume system exporting more N (avg.

20181918-34,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181918.pdf,The impact different farming systems have on soil nitrogen  phosphorus and potassiumâNorthern Region,As our capacity to grow high- yielding grain legumes has increased  so too has our harvest index and hence the ratio of N removed in grain to that left in biomass  thereby diminishing the contributions of residual N after the crop. Phosphorous export was variable across sites  so no conclusions have been drawn regarding P  however the Higher legume system did increase the amount of potassium exported across all sites relative to Baselineâalthough this is not unexpected as legume seed has more than double the K content than cereal grains. In situations where K deficiency may be an emerging issue or where levels are marginal  this greater export under a Higher legume system may mean that nutrients will need to be replaced sooner or a higher level of replacement will be required.
20181918-37,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181918.pdf,The impact different farming systems have on soil nitrogen  phosphorus and potassiumâNorthern Region,The first four years of the farming system project showed that modifying crop systems through higher nutrients did balance the net export of nutrients (N  P) relative to the inputs in several cases. However  there have been few cases where we have seen a positive yield advantage from providing these additional nutrients. This may change as soils age and their inherent fertility declines.

REGIONAL AGRONOMY (RESEARCH) | 33 Implications for growers This pot trial has established that nodulation in mungbeans is severely reduced at soil N concentrations above 10 mg N/kg  which equates to 32 kg N/ha in the top 30 cm of the soil profile. Mungbeans are already widely thought to have a low N threshold for effective nodulation  however to be inhibited at such a low rate could have wide ranging effects on their production.
20192008-7,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192008.pdf,Mungbean: Impact of soil nitrogen levels on nodulation,A potting medium containing no available N (sand: vermiculite mix) was used to grow inoculated (rhizobia strain CB1015) and uninoculated mungbean plants in pots at a range of soil nitrogen levels (Table 1). These N levels (mg N/kg) have been converted to an approximate N level in a field soil (kg N/ha) in the top 30 cm of profile for comparative purposes.

20192008-33,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192008.pdf,Mungbean: Impact of soil nitrogen levels on nodulation,Nodulation was at its highest for this trial when 0  5 or 10 mg N/kg was applied but above this level of N  nodulation number and dry weight of nodules per pot significantly declined for all N levels to 200 mg N/kg (Figure 5). This complements the response seen in the ground biomass and root weights  and shows that when inoculated  a significant amount of N can be fixed by the rhizobia in the nodules formed. However  N concentration in the soil of more than 10 mg N/kg will significantly reduce nodulation to less than half and thereby affect fixation  nutrition and growth of the plants.

The pathway to yield for pulse species and the interaction P nutrition has on this is an on-going area of research. Cumulative grain yields at the three sites demonstrate the potential for increased grain production over multiple years (Table 5).

By plotting the amount of phosphorus taken up at maturity for the cereal crops (wheat and sorghum) against grain yield  the relationship of 277 kg/ha grain per kg of P taken up was found (Figure 5). Increased P supply through deep placement has increased biomass production  and the amount of P taken up as measured at maturity.

Maturity dry matter P uptake (kg P/ha) versus grain yield (kg/ha) in cereal crops grown at Western Downs deep-P sites Implications for growers An application of P as a starter application is still recommended  as sites in this study have demonstrated significant reduction in grain yield when starter was not used. The role of starter P in cereal grains to establish early vigour and set yield potential has been well outlined.

Micro-relief on the site  probably due to gilgais  added site variability during the mungbean growing season (Figure 4). Cereal crops (wheat and sorghum) have a relatively straightforward mechanism to grain yield  with biomass related directly to grain yield via harvest index.

After two crops  both 20 and 30P have generated positive returns at the Condamine North site  whilst 60P has also generated yield benefits at this site with its treatment cost was ~$120/ha more than 30P. The final economics of the different treatments will be dependent on response duration  with higher rates having higher upfront costs  but also expected to have a greater duration. Table 6.

However it has been consistent across all population and row spacing treatments with a 61% increase in yield across 25 cm and 50 cm rows and a 43% increase across 100 cm rows.

There is a definite yield penalty for low plant populations especially in high yielding situations. Plant populations of 8-11 plants/mÂ² can cause yield losses of between 18-24% depending on the yield potential.

There are linear responses to population increases in the 50 cm and 100 cm rows and a significant quadratic response to population in the 25 cm rows. This indicates a major drop off in yield at low populations (11 plants/mÂ²) on 25 cm rows in the irrigated treatments (Figure 3).
201621-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201621.pdf,Mungbean: impacts of time of sowing and irrigation on row spacing and population treatments in summer planted cropsÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Essentially these experiments have found very little response to population changes (10 to 40 plants/mÂ²) and row spacing changes (25 cm to 100 cm rows). Most of this data has been collected across low yielding dryland sites (0.5 to 1.2 t/ha). Coincidentally the crop water use efficiency across these sites have been lower than expected and this has opened up more questions about the water uptake of the crop in relation to stored soil water and in-crop water supply.

Time of sowingâJanuary There were no significant differences for row spacing on its own (Figure 3) across the January TOS. However population was significant with the lowest population causing a significant drop off in yield which was 459 kg/ha lower than the highest population (lsd = 131.1).

The ability of mungbean to produce yields above 1.2 t/ha on good stored moisture profiles is questionable. Timely in-crop water can double yields (on 25 cm rows) even when there is good stored moisture conditions prior to flowering.

Implications for growers While there was no effect of sulfur application on grain yield of this sunflower crop  growers are still advised to be cautious of potential sulfur deficiencies primarily under high intensity double cropping situations from summer crops into winter cereals. An adjacent site demonstrated a small grain yield (250 kg/ha) increase in barely double cropped from sorghum.

201635-6,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201635.pdf,Sunflower: no impact on growth or seed yield with sulfur fertiliserÃ¢ÂÂDarling Downs,As a result  crop responses to sulfur fertiliser appear to be more likely under the following scenarios: 1. the mineralisation of plant available sulfur from organic matter is either low (e.g. during winter) or has a limited time period to occur such as higher cropping intensity (double-cropping)  particularly from summer into winter crops 2.

201635-4,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201635.pdf,Sunflower: no impact on growth or seed yield with sulfur fertiliserÃ¢ÂÂDarling Downs,Background Sulfur (S) is one of the key nutrients necessary for crop growth. Research in Queensland has demonstrated responses to sulfur are often only present after the crop has met its requirement for nitrogen (N)  phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The amount of organic matter in cropping soil has declined as cropping has continued resulting in a loss of organic N and S from the soil nutrient pool.

There also appears to have been greater water extraction in some cover crop treatments in this Yelarbon experiment. While wheat establishment was dramatically better after cover crops at Bungunya  the trial planter configuration and the alignment of plots in the paddock at Yelarbon led to the cotton rows crossing over rows of cover crop stubble  making establishment hard to assess.

150705-19,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/150705.pdf,Advanced Techniques for Managing Subsoil Constraints,In both 2008 and 2009 years  winter crops had dry finish and low yielding zone had significantly higher unused soil moisture after the harvest of crops  which indicated presence of subsoil constraints. Benefits to matching input(s) and/or ameliorating constraint(s) to realistic yield potential were quantified on six sites. For example  on-farm trials conducted on site 1 showed no significant response to applied N in the constrained areas  resulting in a loss of $45/ha/annum with farmerÃ¢ÂÂs uniform rate of N application.

Fortunately  lower rates of P removal in lower-yielding environment should also result in longer timeframes between any repeat applications. At responsive sites  60P has drawn even with 20P after four to six crops  and is expected to offer higher long-term dollar per hectare returns  but with significantly higher upfront risk.

It does appear that residue load (or the lack of) may have had some influence in the efficacy of one or more of the products applied. Equally importantly  the need for rain (and/or tillage into moist soil) to incorporate and active some products also would have influenced the efficacy of some of the products applied.
201650-19,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201650.pdf,Stink grass: efficacy of residual herbicidesÃ¢ÂÂGoovigen,In that trial there was a large amount of biomass to bind with and results suffered  where in this bare fallow field the significantly cheaper Group D product (Group D(2)) performed just as well as the more expensive Group D(1). Given the weather conditions post application  it would not be unreasonable to suspect that the lack of any post application rain to incorporate and activate products like TerbyneÃÂ® XtremeÃÂ® would have played a significant role in its failure to perform. However that should have been the same for the majority of the products applied  especially the Group D and Group K products  and yet some still seemed to have provided excellent control of the stink grass present.

The grass can be prolific in summer fallows and can swamp summer crops such as mungbeans or sorghum if not managed  which will inevitably put significant pressure on the current in-crop Group A options.

It is worth considering trying to offset plant rows from fertiliser rows if planting within six months of a banded fertiliser application. Although most treatments (even the uninoculated ones) showed evidence of nodulation  whether they were truly active in the presence of high levels of N is questionable.

Although the Fallow Surf N treatment was applied four months prior to planting and had two irrigations plus significant rainfall to help dissolve and redistribute the band  this may not have been enough in a heavy Vertosol soil to avoid some fertiliser burn or implications to root development.

It is worth noting that the three highest yielding treatments (Figure 2) had no fertiliser placed in line with the plant row. The other significant issue in the yield data is the control treatment (Nil N) was one of the highest yielding treatments  which indicates that the response to applied N was limited.

Traditionally  most sorghum in Central Queensland (CQ) has been planted in summer to avoid flowering in the periods with the highest risk of heat stress. Spring-sown sorghum crops have also been planted once the risk of frost is gone and soil temperatures rise above 16 ÃÂ°C  but this period is considered very high risk as water/heat stress at flowering is very common.
20192004-26,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192004.pdf,Sorghum: Winter sown sorghum in Central QueenslandÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Implications for growers Spring-planted sorghum has always been considered a high-risk proposition in CQ  and for very good reason. Daily maximum temperatures tend to rise rapidly from approximately 25 ÃÂ°C in mid-August up to 35 ÃÂ°C and higher in early October. The premise of this project was less about soil temperatures at planting as the frost risk is lower in CQ than for southern areas.

20192004-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192004.pdf,Sorghum: Winter sown sorghum in Central QueenslandÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,However  recent research has suggested that winter-sown sorghum may tolerate cold conditions and help target a less risky flowering period. The Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation (QAAFI) leads a Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) research project in partnership with the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) and NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) that is challenging perceptions of how early sorghum can be planted. This 'Optimising sorghum agronomy' project (UOQ 1808-001RTX) is testing the ability of sorghum to germinate and withstand cold temperatures during early growth stages  and so target flowering dates with lower temperatures during flowering and grain fill to minimise heat stress.

Good nutrient supplies are critical to maximise this biomass production. Consequently  a source of nitrogen (legumes  fertilisers  manures) will be needed 1Calculated using 12:1 Food Conversion Efficiency (FCE)  a live weight beef price of $3/kg  and assuming 40% of additional dry matter is consumed it is possible to estimate the economic benefit of these treatments  with urea at $400/t.

The average total organic carbon (TOC) levels at the beginning of the trial were extremely low (0.22% 0Ã¢ÂÂ10 cm and 0.12% 10Ã¢ÂÂ30 cm) reflecting the impact that long-term cropping has on SOC levels on lighter soil types. However  these lighter soils are expected to respond more rapidly to the additional biomass produced by a productive pasture.
201640-9,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201640.pdf,Increasing soil organic matter by applying nitrogen fertiliser to maximise biomass production on established grass pastureÃ¢ÂÂChinchilla,However  a cut in May 2013 prior to frosts  still showed a carry-over yield response to the applied nitrogen of up to 20 kg biomass/kg N. Excellent responses were seen in 2014 due to good rainfall events promoting strong pasture growth. Subsequent years have been less productive  but significant total biomass responses have still been measured between all treatments over the life of the trial. The trial was damaged by pigs June/July 2016.

As such  chickpea crops with high residue loads may also have a greater capacity to compensate for early damage in a dry finish by producing the additional yield on secondary branches. Had these stubble loads been present throughout the preceding fallow  there would likely be more stored water at planting and further increases in grain yields.

This is despite NDVI data showing reduced early crop growth within the higher stubble load treatments. Additional stubble cover also produced significantly more secondary branches in the crop.

Background The efficiency of soil water accumulation during fallows and the availability of that soil water for use by crops are key drivers of northern farming system productivity and profitability. Fallow water is stored and used as a buffer for more reliable grain production in highly variable rainfall patterns.

Conversely  Higher nutrient supply produced crops with greater biomass  which in some cases has allowed small increases in fallow efficiency. Another less obvious trend was that systems with a higher proportion of summer crops had higher fallow efficiency  which may be due to having more fallow periods during the winter when the evaporative potential is lower.

20181920-30,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181920.pdf,Impact of crops and crop sequences on soil water accumulation and use in farming systemsÃ¢ÂÂNorthern Region,The Higher intensity and Lower intensity systems had similar crop WUE to each other  but the Higher crop intensity systems achieved a higher RUE than the Lower crop intensity systems due to their higher fallow efficiency. Despite the differences in RUE  the gross margin return per mm of rainfall is similar for Higher crop intensity and Lower crop intensity systems  which is likely a result of incurring more planting and harvesting costs in the Higher crop intensity systems  balanced by the potential to grow more higher-value and higher-risk crops in the Lower crop intensity systems. 102 | QUEENSLAND GRAINS RESEARCH 2018Ã¢ÂÂ19 Implications for growers These trials show that the systems that most efficiently converted water (stored and rainfall) to grain and gross margin were those with a higher proportion of cereal crops and a cropping intensity of one crop per year.

Comparing these crops in terms of gross margin per mm of rain ($/mmÃ¢ÂÂincluding fallow rain) showed that in most cases the best returns were from short fallows  which is the cropping intensity targeted by our Baseline systems (Table 2).

However  the trial results reinforce that an understanding of soil P levels and the cropping history of the paddock is needed to develop fertiliser programs for mungbean crops. While this trial didn't show differences in levels of AMF colonisation by the end of the experiment  itÃ¢ÂÂs likely that the heating treatments reduced AMF levels  slowing initial colonisation in the Nil AMF treatments and showing significant contrasts with plants growing in the Low or High AMF treatments with low P soil (5 and 10 mg P/kg). Mungbeans grown after a long fallow where AMF levels are low and colonisation is reduced in the early crop stages will require a level of 10 to 20 mg P/kg (44 to 87 kg P/ha) to increase plant growth.
20192009-4,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192009.pdf,Mungbean: Impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on phosphorus requirements,4. If arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi levels are low at planting and/or soil phosphorus is low  consider applying a higher rate of phosphorus fertiliser (approximately 10 mg P/kg or 44 kg P/ha or above) to improve growth and production. Background Ensuring adequate phosphorus (P) supply to plants is key for good mungbean production.
20192009-19,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192009.pdf,Mungbean: Impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on phosphorus requirements,the AMF supported a response to added P that was not seen at the rates of 20 mg P/kg and above. There was no significant difference in response to AMF until the P level reached the highest rate of 320 mg/kg  where growth at the Low AMF level was significantly higher than Nil and High AMF. High AMF levels may start to drain carbohydrates from the plant when there is adequate P. If the plant doesnÃ¢ÂÂt need AMF to assimilate P  it may become a burden on the plant and reduce biomass production.

When P is as low as it was in this case  with just 3 mg available P/kg (Colwell P)  the level of AMF made no difference to plant growth. At 5 and 10 mg P/kg rates  the plants with nil AMF were significantly lower in biomass than those with Low or High AMF soil levels;

20192009-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192009.pdf,Mungbean: Impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on phosphorus requirements,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)  previously known as VAM  form a symbiotic relationship with plant roots to supply them with P and zinc (Zn). Recent weather patterns that have enforced long fallows can reduce AMF levels in the soil. Mungbean has a high mycorrhizal dependency  so there is a risk to mungbean production if growers do not adequately address P nutrition.

Steam sterilisation of the soil may be needed in future to ensure full sterilisation. The slightly lower (not significant) colonisation levels combined with the lower root weights recorded in the 5 and 10 mg P/kg treatments may explain the lower biomass measured for the Nil AMF plants at these P levels and the corresponding response in biomass to Low and High AMF levels.

Trial results also showed significant differences between the three TOSs  824 kg/ha (December TOS) to 1597 kg/ha (March TOS) driven by the different weather conditions across the growing season.

This site is proving that the most limiting nutrient will always make the biggest difference to yield but once the nutrient has been lifted then other nutrients  particularly K and N  can have an impact on yield.

201641-1,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201641.pdf,Farming systems research,REGIONAL AGRONOMY NETWORK | 153 Farming systems research Advances in agronomy and the performance of individual crops have helped grain growers to maintain their profitability. However  there is evidence that the current farming systems are underperforming; with only 30% of the crop sequences in Queensland and New South Wales (northern grains region) achieving 75% of their water limited yield potential.
201641-3,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201641.pdf,Farming systems research,Can systems performance be improved by modifying farming systems in the northern grains region? This research question is being addressed at two levels; to look at the systems performance across the whole grains region  and to provide rigorous data on the performance of local farming systems at key locations across Queensland and New South Wales.
201641-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201641.pdf,Farming systems research,Experiments were established at seven locations; with a large factorial experiment managed by CSIRO at Pampas near Toowoomba  and locally relevant systems being studied at six regional centres by Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) in Queensland and the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) in New South Wales (Table 1). Several of these systems are represented at every site to allow major insights across the northern grains region  while the site specific systems will provide insights for local conditions.

20171813-51,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171813.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied phosphorus in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,It is imperative that growers understand these variables and to what extent they can influence results from deep fertiliser applications. Crop species  in-crop rainfall and starting soil nutrients can all have a large influence on the scale of response to deep-banded nutrients. Basically all of these variables are based around the central concept of plant uptake.
20171813-52,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171813.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied phosphorus in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,Availability of water and nutrients in the profile  the size of the root system and its structure and the critical timing of when plants are setting up yield  all play roles in determining nutrient uptake. It is critical for growers and agronomists to understand which zone of the soil profile is depleted in macronutrients and by how much. Soil testing in the appropriate increments (0Ã¢ÂÂ10ÃÂ cm  10Ã¢ÂÂ30 cm etc.)
20171813-31,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171813.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied phosphorus in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,In contrast  the chickpea crop of 2016 had the advantage of good in-crop rainfall  with significant falls after sowing and then again from around the start of flowering (57-65 DAS). In theory  the plant should have been able to access nutrients out of the surface profile and not needed to use the deep bands of fertiliser  however the yield results suggest the deep fertiliser bands have been accessed by the plant. This could be partly due to deep planting the chickpeas (10-15 cm)  which meant the seed would have been placed below the relatively nutrient-rich surface layer.
20171813-30,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171813.pdf,Seasonal differences in response to deep-applied phosphorus in chickpea and wheatÃ¢ÂÂCentral Queensland,The implication of this was that the wheat plants did not have the capacity to develop a root system of sufficient size or surface area. The plant may have been able to access the deep bands of fertiliser but simply could not grow enough root mass around these fertiliser bands to effectively take advantage. The surface soil would have been dry for most of the crop's life so access to any of the surface nutrient would have been limited.
20171812-48,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171812.pdf,Residual value of deep placed phosphorus  potassium and sulfur in scrub soilsÃ¢ÂÂDysart,The first message is that nitrogen availability can have a dominating impact on the yield of cereal species. If N is low  the responses to added P and K may not be expressed as the crops remain N deficient . Protein levels for the last sorghum crop at this site were low (8.1%) which indicates nitrogen levels in the soil were either depleted or unavailable (trapped in the dry surface soil layers).
20171812-49,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171812.pdf,Residual value of deep placed phosphorus  potassium and sulfur in scrub soilsÃ¢ÂÂDysart,This may be one of the main reasons for the chickpea crop having such dramatic improvement in response to the deep P and K applications  compared to the previous sorghum crops. The second message is that while grain legumes can fix their own N and so ensure that the response to P and K is more likely to be evident  their grains also have a much higher content of P and K compared to cereals (10 kg/t versus 3.5 kg/t for K  3 kg/t versus 1.8 kg/t for P). Therefore  while overcoming a P and K nutrient limitation by deep banding will have a more consistent effect on yields of grain legumes such as chickpeas compared to crops like wheat or sorghum  the rate of export of applied P and K means fertiliser rundown will potentially occur faster with higher legume frequencies.
20171812-40,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171812.pdf,Residual value of deep placed phosphorus  potassium and sulfur in scrub soilsÃ¢ÂÂDysart,The yield benefits from the high K treatment (100K) in this chickpea crop (29-43%  depending on yield data used) were a much higher percentage difference than had occurred in previous sorghum crops (Figure 4). As discussed for the P trials  this may reflect either low N availability limiting yields of the cereal crops and/or a higher requirement for K by the chickpea crops. Figure 4.
20192022-64,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192022.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,The Higher legume system had benefited significantly from the two chickpea crops in 2015 and 2017. However  the effect of the 2017 chickpea crop on fallow efficiency into the next sorghum crop  and then the frost damage to the 2019 chickpea crop has pulled this system's economic performance back to the pack. REGIONAL AGRONOMY (RESEARCH) | 93 The manure applied in the Higher soil fertility system has resulted in the system excelling for most indices and it continues to draw away from the rest of the systems.
20192022-2,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192022.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,The Higher soil fertility system continues to outperform all other systems across most indices measured. 2. Several frost events in July reduced chickpea yields significantly  limiting the performance of both systems planted to chickpea in 2019 (Higher crop intensity and Higher legume).
20192022-24,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192022.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Screenings (%) showed a clear difference between the systems  with the Higher soil fertility system 1% higher than the other Frost damage in chickpea.

20192022-34,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192022.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Of interest is also the steady improvement in WUE from the first crop through to the 2019 winter crop for all systems. With its shorter fallow periods  the Higher crop intensity system has had the highest fallow efficiency of all systems  however that efficiency has come at the cost of the lowest grain and biomass WUEs (Table 3). Higher soil fertility systemÃ¢ÂÂs grain WUE is 0.5 kg mm/ha higher than the next closest system (Higher legume) which is quite substantial considering EmeraldÃ¢ÂÂs average rainfall of 600 mm per year.

As residual herbicides can be variable in their control and efficacy  it is important to use them in combination with other weed management tactics. For example  if applying a residual for fallow weed control  make sure any weed escapes are controlled (either with knockdown herbicides  targeted tillage or manual removal)  and consider following with a competitive crop to provide added control.
20181923-8,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181923.pdf,Residual herbicidesÃ¢ÂÂlength of residual and efficacy: a summary of 18 trials across Queensland,In 2015/16  the trials targeted a range of difficult to control weeds  with treatments selected to target either grass weeds  broadleaf weeds  or a combination when both were expected. One site targeted sowthistle  one site targeted FTR and seven sites targeted mixed populations of sowthistle and grasses (one SSG  one FTR  one stink grass and four ABYG). After reviewing the 2015/16 results  2016/17 treatments were determined  with a greater emphasis placed on evaluating mixtures of residual herbicides  and with a focus on establishing trial sites likely to grow sowthistle.

This trial again supports that the 25ÃÂ cm not only extracts more water from the profile but also converts this water more efficiently to grain. Due to the consistent rain throughout the season and the late rainfall from cyclone Debbie  there was no significant difference between the dryland and irrigated treatments however the trend for more yield with irrigation was evident with higher yields achieved at the 25 cm row spacing.

Soil water for dryland (a) and irrigated (b) mungbeans at 100 cm row spacing at three dates during the growing season (solid lines are between the rows and dashed line in the row) Implications for growers Mungbeans planted on the narrower row spacing of 25 cm produced greater yield across all treatments compared to the wider 100 cm spacing. This is consistent with previous trials conducted as part of the Pulse Agronomy project.

Therefore any significant differences in dry matter and grain yield were assumed to be driven by row spacing treatments. REGIONAL AGRONOMY | 35 Dry matter production Significant differences were observed in the TOS1 trial  with higher dry matter production in the 25 cm row spacing.

Significant differences were measured due to row spacing and an interaction between row spacing and irrigation. In line with dry matter production  grain was maximised at the narrower row spacing  the 25ÃÂ cm treatment averaging 3000 kg/ha and 100 cm 2337 kg/ha when dryland and irrigated yields were combined.

At 100 cm row spacing  it was noticeable that there was little to no water movement below 105ÃÂ cm for the dryland treatment (Figure 4a) whereas there was in the 25 cm row spacing. With both the irrigated and the dryland  by the start of March (mid pod fill) more soil water had been removed from the between row position than in the row to a depth of 65 cm.

Total soil moisture removal is increased from the inter row space with 100 cm row spacing  however it is suggested that this is driven by evaporation and not transpiration and it was interesting to see similar water use between all treatments with the greatest removal to a depth of 65 cm  but with continuing removal to 105ÃÂ cm and beyond in some cases  indicated that mungbeans have a much larger rooting depth than the traditionally believed 60 cm.

Temperatures then dropped and conversion from biomass to grain yield did not allow for expected HI. Implications for growers Mungbeans planted on narrower row spacings (25 and 50 cm) produced greater yield across all treatments.

This is significant given that sorghum is not known as the most responsive species to phosphorus and there has been some variability in the seasonal constraints. Although K has not shown as bigger difference as P over the last three years  it has shown to add a small but consistent response to crop yield (7-8%).
201632-27,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201632.pdf,Sorghum: residual value of deep placed phosphorus  potassium and sulfur in scrub soilsÃ¢ÂÂDysart,This is proving that one application of deep placed K can continue to be accessed by the plants over at least three years. Responses to K were expected to be bigger at this site given soil test values of 0.12 meq/100g or less (10 to 60 cm)  however the complication of the P levels also being in deficit has seemingly overshadowed the K response. The sulfur response at this site remains a mystery given low soil test values that have traditionally been considered responsive to additional sulfur.

This trial data does confirm the role that P and K is playing at this trial site with consistent reductions in yield when the background P and K are left out of the treatment (7-8%). The trial has also consistently shown a major reduction in yield in the FR plots where not only is P and K missing but the supply of nitrogen has also been reduced.

Previous trials showed no impact on yield from row spacing and population changes  however these data sets were generated in low yielding situations (0.5 t/ha to 1.2 t/ha). However  this trial yielded between 1.5 t/ha and 2 t/ha and demonstrated a significant improvement in grain yield due to narrow rows (25 to 50 cm) and a significant loss of yield at low populations (<13 plants/mÃÂ²).
201619-4,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201619.pdf,Mungbean: yield response to row spacing and plant population under high yielding conditionsÃ¢ÂÂBiloela,Most of these trials produced low to average yields  with the data sets indicating little consistent yield difference between any of the row spacing and plant population treatments. All of these trials produced yields less than 1.2 t/ha. The project team were interested in assessing the impact of row spacing and plant population on the full range of mungbeans yields that have been historically achieved in the CQ region to date.
201619-15,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201619.pdf,Mungbean: yield response to row spacing and plant population under high yielding conditionsÃ¢ÂÂBiloela,There was no significant difference between 25 and 50 cm nor between 75 and 100 cm rows. However there was a highly significant difference between 25 and 50 cm rows in comparison to 75 and 100 cm rows. This indicates that a narrow row configuration (25 to 50 cm) will provide a yield benefit (24% or 380 kg/ha) in both dry matter and grain yield in situations where there is higher yield potential (>1.5 t/ha).
201619-14,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201619.pdf,Mungbean: yield response to row spacing and plant population under high yielding conditionsÃ¢ÂÂBiloela,This population data is limited by the fact that there were no populations above 25 plants/mÃÂ² so it cannot be proved that higher populations (>30 plants/mÃÂ²) would have achieved similar or better yields than 25 plants/mÃÂ². It is clear that the mungbean plant can compensate for differences in populations but there is a limit to this when populations are approaching 10 plants/mÃÂ² and potentials yields are above 1.5 t/ha. The row spacing results (Figure 3) indicate a significant difference between narrow and wide row spacings.
201619-13,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201619.pdf,Mungbean: yield response to row spacing and plant population under high yielding conditionsÃ¢ÂÂBiloela,Results There was a significant reduction in both dry matter and grain yields with populations averaging 13 plants/m2. However there was no significant difference between 18 and 24 plants/mÃÂ² at a yield of 1.8 to 1.9 t/ha (Figure 2). This would indicate that there is a lower limit to population targets when potential yields are above 1.5 t/ha.

The fastest way to build carbon is under a grass only system with annual applications of nitrogen  as legumes are slower to establish and produce less biomass in the same time period. This work suggests that impacts will take several growing seasons (three in this case) to show increases in SOC.

Implications for growers Well grown pasture phases will slow the decline  and/or increase total organic carbon in the soil. However  there is strong evidence that pastures must be productive with good nutrient supplies to make a major contribution.

Background The establishment of a productive sown grass pasture phase is the most promising practice available to mixed farmers looking to improve their soil organic carbon (SOC) levels on degraded cropping land. However  these pastures must be well grown with good nutrient supplies to make a major contribution.

This nitrogen can be supplied to the system by the inclusion of a legume in the pasture mix or by the addition of nitrogen fertiliser. This trial compared the effectiveness of three different approaches on increasing pasture production and ultimately soil carbon.

The late flowering and length of pod fill time meant HI were below expectation and yields did not reflect the large biomasses. Seasonal conditions such as the high in-crop rain and delay to pod set until late in the year (when 15ÃÂ°C average temperatures were achieved) were responsible for lower yields and HIs.

Results The 2016 winter season saw late planting rains  a very wet spring  and cool temperatures that delayed pod set and maturity. In-crop rainfall to 19 December when the crop was ready for harvest was 479 mm for TOS 1 and 379 mm for TOS 2.

The Ã¢ÂÂequivalent fertiliserÃ¢ÂÂ applied at normal depth with the seed produced the same result as the manure  indicating that grain yield responded to the amount of REGIONAL AGRONOMY | 103 nutrients and where they were placed  rather than the source. These treatment differences were similarly reflected in total dry matter measurements.

201625-3,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201625.pdf,Nutrition research,The 2016 winter and summer seasons have shown some conflicting results across nutrition trial sites. Sorghum crops planted on several trial sites have shown up to a 25% response in grain yield to deep P applications in both southern (Lundavra and Jimbour West) and central Queensland (Clermont and Dysart). Some of these sites were on their third crop since treatments were first applied which is starting to demonstrate the longevity of P and K applications.

Implications for growers The depletion of phosphorus in the soil profile can have major consequences on grain yields in sorghum. This trial has demonstrated a yield increase of between 20-40% across deep P treatments of which some of this could be attributed to a response to surface applied P of 8-9%.
20192021-39,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192021.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂMungindi,While 2019 was too dry to grow crops  the presence of stubble and higher ground cover in some systems helped reduce the wind erosion that led to widespread dust storms that year. The Baseline performed well in the first two years with good yields and gross margins. This relatively low-input system has minimised losses through the three drought years of 2017 to 2020 to maintain the highest gross margin over the full five years.
20192021-38,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192021.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂMungindi,However  two of the three systems with summer crops had a yield benefit to the following winter crop. The yield benefit from the cotton break crop for the 2018 wheat in Lower crop intensity (mixed) provided the largest return in the three drought years of 2017 to 2020  while Higher crop diversity was the only other system to grow a profitable crop in this period  again following the sunflower and sorghum summer crops. Implications for growers Maintaining high ground cover has been beneficial to accumulate soil water for cropping opportunities throughout the recent drought.

The same crop as the Baseline is grown to compare the two systems. Systems were implemented following these rules  with a range of crops grown in 2015 and 2016 across the different systems (Figure 1). Unfortunately  low rainfall in 2017 did not accumulate sufficient PAW to plant any systems  so a wheat cover crop was planted in Baseline  Higher nutrient supply  Higher legume and Lower crop intensity (winter) systems to maintain ground cover above 30%.
20192021-25,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192021.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂMungindi,However  with the dry conditions experienced in the district in 2019  wind erosion was a common problem and the stubble provided was sufficient to reduce this wind erosion across the Lower crop intensity (winter) plots (Figure 2). The soil water used by the cover crop was equivalent to that lost to evaporation in the other five systems that were left fallow during this extremely dry period. Figure 2.

The remaining water combined with 135 mm rainfall from crop maturity to the end of November  provided an opportunity to double-crop these systems to sorghum. The Higher crop intensity system was fallowed from May 2018 so also achieved its planting trigger.
20192020-23,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192020.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,On 26 November 2018  the Baseline  Higher nutrient supply  Higher soil fertility and Higher legume systems were planted to MR-Taurus sorghum  with 140 mm plant available water (PAW)  and the Higher crop intensity system with 100 mm PAW. The sorghum was planted on two metre solid rows  but with only 35 mm of in-crop rainfall  all systems were sprayed out on 4 March 2019. Biomass was ~2 t/ha in the four systems double-cropped from chickpeas  and 1.2 t/ha in Higher crop intensity fallowed from sorghum.
20192020-33,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192020.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,These high starting nitrogen levels and the high proportion of winter cereal crops in the Baseline system produced a high income and the highest return on variable costs (ROVC  Table 2). The Higher nutrient supply and Higher soil fertility systems had similar income but lower ROVC because of their higher fertiliser expenses. The Higher legume and Higher crop diversity systems have similar ROVC to the Higher nutrient supply system driven by their lower income and the higher inputs (herbicide  insecticide and fungicide) when growing pulse crops.
20192020-62,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192020.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,Cumulative nitrogen removal by the systems largely reflects grain yields. However  the Higher legume system recorded similar N removal to the Baseline for lower grain yield due to the higher grain protein of the legume crops. Higher mineral N levels were maintained in the Higher legume  Lower crop intensity and Higher soil fertility systems than the Baseline  Higher nutrient supply  Higher crop diversity and Higher crop intensity systems.
20192020-50,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192020.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,Higher crop diversity was similar to the Baseline; the 2018 canola used most of the available mineral N by harvest  but recycled this N (as the stubble decomposed) by the next sampling date. The Higher legume system has maintained higher mineral N than the Baseline for the same crop nitrogen removal  maintaining a similar level to the Higher soil fertility system.
20192020-38,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192020.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,Water use There have been some interesting system effects on individual crops grown at the same time. The double-cropped mungbean crop in 2016 (Higher crop intensity) was planted with the same starting water as the Baseline system  that was fallowed over summer and planted to barley in 2016. The fallow efficiency (the change in soil stored water as a percentage of fallow rainfall) was 72% for the Higher crop intensity system but only 30% in the Baseline system (Figure 2).
20192020-63,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192020.pdf,Farming systems site reportÃ¢ÂÂBilla Billa,However  these differences were also reflected in the organic carbon changes that are emerging between the systems. After four years the Lower crop intensity system and Higher legume systems have seen the greatest drop in OC. These two systems  along with Higher soil fertility  have also mineralised more N. The Higher soil fertility system is the only Ã¢ÂÂcroppingÃ¢ÂÂ system to register an increase in soil OC  albeit with only 3 t/ha of the original 10 t/ha of OC remaining;
20192008-26,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192008.pdf,Mungbean: Impact of soil nitrogen levels on nodulation,The letters on each bar are presented to show significant differences at P(0.05). REGIONAL AGRONOMY (RESEARCH) | 33 Implications for growers This pot trial has established that nodulation in mungbeans is severely reduced at soil N concentrations above 10 mg N/kg  which equates to 32 kg N/ha in the top 30 cm of the soil profile. Mungbeans are already widely thought to have a low N threshold for effective nodulation  however to be inhibited at such a low rate could have wide ranging effects on their production.
20192008-7,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192008.pdf,Mungbean: Impact of soil nitrogen levels on nodulation,A potting medium containing no available N (sand: vermiculite mix) was used to grow inoculated (rhizobia strain CB1015) and uninoculated mungbean plants in pots at a range of soil nitrogen levels (Table 1). These N levels (mg N/kg) have been converted to an approximate N level in a field soil (kg N/ha) in the top 30 cm of profile for comparative purposes.
20192008-2,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192008.pdf,Mungbean: Impact of soil nitrogen levels on nodulation,Key findings 1. Mungbeans may stop nodulating when soil nitrogen concentration is >10 mg N/kg (32 kg N/ha). 2.

20192008-33,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192008.pdf,Mungbean: Impact of soil nitrogen levels on nodulation,Nodulation was at its highest for this trial when 0  5 or 10 mg N/kg was applied but above this level of N  nodulation number and dry weight of nodules per pot significantly declined for all N levels to 200 mg N/kg (Figure 5). This complements the response seen in the ground biomass and root weights  and shows that when inoculated  a significant amount of N can be fixed by the rhizobia in the nodules formed. However  N concentration in the soil of more than 10 mg N/kg will significantly reduce nodulation to less than half and thereby affect fixation  nutrition and growth of the plants.
20192005-2,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192005.pdf,Pulse research,Key learnings from trial sites located in Central Queensland (CQ) and Southern Queensland (SQ) were that high nitrate levels in the top 30 cm of the soil profile did not promote better yields than corresponding control treatments  whether the crop was inoculated or not. Natural mineralisation levels at both sites were quite high  with even the control treatments having access to over 100 kg N/ha down to 120 cm of soil depth. Glasshouse pot trials conducted in the 2019/20 season showed that a background level of 32 kg N/ha in the top 30 cm of soil will reduce rhizobia populations significantly and caused a slight reduction in biomass production.
20192005-3,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192005.pdf,Pulse research,Soil nitrate levels above 32 kg/ha did not significantly increase dry matter yield for either inoculated or uninoculated plants. It appears that high levels of nitrate in the soil does not increase mungbean grain yield or biomass  which is consistent with the initial findings from field trials in 2018/19. Other glasshouse experiments have tried to quantify the impact of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) on the uptake of phosphorus (P) in the plant at different soil concentration levels.
20192005-4,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192005.pdf,Pulse research,High levels of AMF significantly increased biomass production in mungbeans at low levels of soil P concentration (5Ã¢ÂÂ10 mg/kg). Once soil P levels exceeded 20 mg/kg  the AMF effect became negligible on biomass production. It is also worth noting that P concentration in the plant continued to increase as soil P levels increased all the way to 320 mg/kg  even though maximum biomass response was reached at 20 mg/kg.

Furthermore  we have confidence that treatment benefits will last for at least 5 crops after the application of deep P.

201656-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201656.pdf,Pathology research,Depending on location  crop and variety  yield loss varied greatly  with all three crops showing significant yield losses on susceptible varieties. Durum wheats appeared to be the most susceptible with significant yield loss  while the barley varieties showed the least yield losses across all crops. However these yield losses were still economically significant and highlight the affect crown rot could be having to winter grain production in Queensland and the need to be vigilant in managing the pathogen to minimise yield loss.
20181904-2,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20181904.pdf,Pulse research,These trials not only gave information that can be directly related to best practice agronomic recommendations but can also help define the plants' key physiological characteristics  which in turn can be used to inform future areas of productivity improvement. The 2018 mungbean trials were the last data collected for this project and have basically confirmed a number of key findings from previous mungbean trial data. For example  yield differences in row spacing were not significant this year  however given the hard season (hot and dry)  yields were low and narrow rows do not generally give any advantage until yields get close to 1.5 ton/ha;

When pulses are grown on soil with high available nitrogen  they will fix less nitrogen and export large amounts in their grain. Pulses remain highly profitable  but large nitrogen benefits will only accrue when soil nitrate levels are low  typically in double crop situations or on soils with declining fertility.

The cropping systems have been developed around this 20+ year old variety  and its propensity to compensate for sub-ideal establishments or above average rainfall years  yet still yield in poor seasons. The ability of MR-Buster to compensate has allowed target populations to be reduced  and row spacing to be widened with lower yield loss in an above average year and some security of income in a below average season.

20192027-19,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192027.pdf,Cover crops: Soil water was not reduced on a long fallow during a droughtÃ¢ÂÂGoondiwindi,Due to the ongoing dry winter  the farm used the last of their water to grow their cover crop through to yield and did not grow cotton that year. Soil water was estimated using soil cores to measure gravimetric soil water at key times  along with regular neutron moisture meters (NMM) and EM38 readings in each plot. These readings and the percentage of ground cover were recorded every 2Ã¢ÂÂ4 weeks.

However  the extra cover in the Mid and Late-terminated treatments continued to boost infiltration later in the fallow. Background Approximately 60% of rainfall in northern farming systems is lost to evaporation  with transpiration through plants typically only 20-40%.

By the end of November  most cover crops had recovered PAW differences  only the Late-terminated sorghum and wheat were drier in the 60-90 cm layer. Rainfall in 2019 was very low  so differences began to emerge and the treatments with low cover dried out in the 0-30 cm layer more than those with more ground cover (i.e. where the lines cross in Figure 3).

Background Crown rot (CR) caused predominantly by the fungus Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fp)  remains a major constraint to the production of winter cereals in Queensland and northern New South Wales. Cereal varieties differ in their resistance to crown rot which can have a significant impact on their relative yield in the presence of this disease.

The range of yield loss from the bread wheat varieties was from 39% for EGA GregoryP (a susceptible variety) to 16% for MitchP  SunguardP and LongReach GauntletP (all moderately susceptible varieties). It is interesting to note that the only other MS rated variety  LongReach SpitfireP lost 35% of its yield.

What was done? The trial consisted of: Ã¢ÂÂ¢
201658-11,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201658.pdf,Wheat and barley: regional crown rot managementÃ¢ÂÂWestmar,in the presence of crown rot  the yield of these two varieties was reduced to 61% and 67% of the untreated yield respectively. This equates to a susceptible (S) or MSS rating when compared to the yield loss for EGA GregoryP and LongReach FlankerP. The durum varieties all performed very poorly. The yield of JandaroiP was reduced by 52%  the yield of DBA LillaroiP was reduced by 49% and the yield of the experimental line 190873 was reduced by 45%.

In terms of water use efficiency (WUE) (Figure 5)  the 1.5 m row spacing made better use of the water available during the growing season  with the 40 000 plants/ha treatment having the highest WUE. In contrast  WUE of the 1 m configurations declines with increased population.
20171805-25,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171805.pdf,Maize: hybrid by population by row configurationÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Even in low density treatments  tillers accounted for less than 10% of total biomass  which flowed through to yield. At the low density 1 m treatment  tillers accounted for less than 9% of total yield  and made negligible contributions to yield in the high density treatments. Both yield and biomass  for this particular trial  point towards the wider row spacing configuration being the optimum configuration at a plant population of 40 000 plants/ha.

Irrespective of the hybrid or plant population  1.5 m wide rows yielded about 0.5 t/ha more than 1 m rows (Table 3). A population of 40 000 plants/ha provided higer yields than 20 000 or 80 000 (Figure 3).

This can be attributed to the unusually dry season  which caused the crop to run out of moisture before crop yield potentials could be reached. These results are in line with previous trials highlighting the benefit of narrow row spacing on dry matter accumulation  however these past trials also indicated increased yields under these narrow row spacings.

In the subtropical cropping regions of Queensland and New South Wales (NSW)  herbicide resistance to fallow-applied knockdown herbicides  especially glyphosate (Group M)  is making reliable control of key summer and winter fallow weeds difficult. There are now eight weed species resistant to glyphosate including flaxleaf fleabane (Conyza bonariensis)  awnless barnyard grass (Echinochloa colona)  feathertop Rhodes grass (Chloris virgata)  windmill grass (Chloris truncata)  liverseed grass (Urochloa panicoides)  annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) and sweet summer grass (Brachiaria eruciformis).

20171828-2,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20171828.pdf,Weeds research,Physical properties of residual herbicides such as solubility  ultraviolet stability and soil or stubble binding characteristics vary by product. Efficacy can also be affected by environmental factors  such as soil type  rainfall  temperature and ground cover. In order to better understand how different herbicides perform under varying conditions it is necessary to gather local efficacy and persistence data across a range of environments and seasons.

The non-CR host crops (cotton  maize  mungbean and sorghum) provided the best way to reduce CR inoculum while the non-host winter crops (canola  chickpea and faba bean) had virtually no impact on CR inoculum.

This was probably due to these systems providing more time or an improved environment for stubble breakdown. High N input continuous wheat systems led to the largest increase in CR inoculum and highlights why this rotation is actively discouraged  especially in environments where stubble breakdown is slow.

This observation is of concern  with the inclusion of summer crops such as sorghum providing a disease break for other pathogens such as CR and P. thornei. Resistant or non-host crops may reduce inoculum loads  but several consecutive resistant crops coupled with fallows offer the best rotation option to reduce very high pathogen loads.

Background Traditional summer rainfall reliability has diminished in recent years  so growers have become more reliant on stored moisture  rather than in-crop rainfall. To give greater security in crop production of both sorghum and maize in a dryland scenario  growers have widened row spacing and lowered target populations to try to better manage the limited water available in the profile.

There were no statistically significant changes to yield contribution no matter what population or row spacing configuration was used in this trial  although there was a strong trend indicating that lower population and row density treatments (solid treatments) had higher tiller counts than higher population or density treatments.

201603-24,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201603.pdf,Sorghum: measuring the effect on yield  quality and plant structure when manipulating hybrid variety  population and row spacingÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,General observations match with the harvest index numbers which indicate that despite having good starting water profile  the crop set up for a big yield  but the lack of good follow-up rain at or before flowering and grain fill meant that particularly the high population treatments were not able to finish the job. At a broader level  what has been highlighted is the need to understand hybrid attributes to better match with seasonal conditions to achieve market specifications. For example  in a tough year with a lower profile of water  MR-Apollo at 40 000 solid may give a higher harvest index  larger seed  and minimal tillers  however that configuration will never maximise yield  if good in-crop rain comes  when compared to a higher population and or a higher tillering variety.
20192024-2,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192024.pdf,Farming systems: Water dynamics and the impact of crop sequences over time,Key findings 1. The water use efficiency of crops is lower when chickpea  wheat or sorghum have less than 80 mm  100 mm or 120 mm respectively prior to planting. Waiting until soil moisture reaches these levels is critical to maximise conversion of accumulated soil moisture into grain.
20192024-32,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192024.pdf,Farming systems: Water dynamics and the impact of crop sequences over time,Crops of wheat  chickpea and sorghum that had less than 100 mm of plant available water coming into the season  had much less chance of achieving a high crop WUE; crops planted on lower soil moisture are more at risk of depleting the soil profile prior to flowering and grain-fill without significant in-crop rain. The data suggest that chickpea may be less susceptible to this than wheat or sorghum.
20192024-51,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192024.pdf,Farming systems: Water dynamics and the impact of crop sequences over time,The efficiency of this fallow storage is driven by the stubble left by the previous crop and the duration of the fallow period. Crop type also influences how efficiently crop water use is converted to grain. This research suggests storing more than 80 mm  100 mm or 120 mm PAW prior to planting chickpea  wheat or sorghum (respectively) increases the likelihood of optimising crop WUE.
20192024-39,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192024.pdf,Farming systems: Water dynamics and the impact of crop sequences over time,The WUE of crops generally increased with the soil water available at planting. Crops of wheat  chickpea and sorghum that had less than 100 mm of plant available water coming into the season  had much less chance of achieving a high crop WUE; crops planted on lower soil moisture are more at risk of depleting the soil profile prior to flowering and grain-fill without significant in-crop rain.
20192024-26,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192024.pdf,Farming systems: Water dynamics and the impact of crop sequences over time,A large portion of that seasonÃ¢ÂÂs rain fell in spring  when both the chickpea and cotton crops were both in the ground  but with very little additional rainfall from chickpea harvest to cotton harvest. The cotton in the Lower crop intensity system left the soil 32 mm drier than the chickpea at their respective harvests. However  the chickpea ground was 19 mm drier when the cotton was picked and a combination of residual wheat stubble and dry cracked soil post-cotton resulted in the Lower crop intensity system having an extra 15 mm PAW when the two systems were planted to wheat in 2018.
20192024-48,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192024.pdf,Farming systems: Water dynamics and the impact of crop sequences over time,Late in a long fallow  the cover levels will be lower and the soil wetter  so there is less scope for infiltration and more evaporation. The impacts of particular crops on the accumulation of soil water in the following fallow should be considered in the cropping sequence. For example  a fallow receiving 400 mm of rain after a winter cereal may accumulate 120 mm on average  while the same fallow after a grain legume may only accumulated 80 mm.

20192024-29,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192024.pdf,Farming systems: Water dynamics and the impact of crop sequences over time,Data collected from the farming systems experiments show that the 'marginal' WUE (kg/mm from additional crop water use) reached its potential at 24 kg/mm for wheat  12.5 kg/mm for chickpea and 18 kg/mm for grain sorghum. Despite this potential and good crop management in these experiments  the average across all the crops measured was Figure 5. PAW dynamics of two of the Mungindi cropping systems.
20192024-40,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192024.pdf,Farming systems: Water dynamics and the impact of crop sequences over time,The data suggest that chickpea may be less susceptible to this than wheat or sorghum. ChickpeaÃ¢ÂÂs indeterminate growth habit means it has a lower water requirement prior to the start of grain filling and the grain yield potential builds throughout the season. This makes chickpea yield less susceptible to acute water stress at critical phenological stages than cereals that build biomass and then convert it to grain yield.
201605-18,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201605.pdf,Wheat: the effects of different planting dates on yield and plant physiology across different varietiesÃ¢ÂÂGoondiwindi,Both this trial and the 2015 trial have achieved the best yields by flowering around 30 August  which is the date CliMate indicates both heat stress and frost risk are lowest. However variation in the window around this date between the two seasons reinforces the benefit of using a combination of varieties with varying maturity and multiple planting dates to spread the risk of frost and heat stress. All varieties will mature faster if planted late in the season  but once planting dates are delayed such that flowering within the ideal window is not possible  maximum yields would be achieved by planting the quickest maturing varieties available.
201605-15,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201605.pdf,Wheat: the effects of different planting dates on yield and plant physiology across different varietiesÃ¢ÂÂGoondiwindi,The bigger impact between the two seasons was the fact that frosts occurred 30 days later in 2016 than the 2015 season. TOS 4 varieties had shorter period to anthesis than TOS 2 and TOS 3. This reduction in days to anthesis has allowed some of the quick maturing varieties to flower late inside the ideal window  producing similar yields as their earlier TOS  but with increased screenings due to the heat stress.

Implications for growers This trial demonstrated a yield benefit for matching the planting date with the length to maturity of a variety to maximise yield potential. With the presence of multiple frosts in this season there was a greater benefit to delaying flowering than observed in the 2015 trial  however the yield penalty for delaying flowering later than ideal has had a much greater impact.

201638-21,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201638.pdf,The economics of deep placement of phosphorus in Queensland and northern NSW,It is believed that in-season rainfall will allow plant access to P in the 0Ã¢ÂÂ10 cm layer  reducing the reliance on subsoil P  thus reducing the potential benefits. Seasons where there is minimal in-season rainfall are expected to obtain greater benefit from deep-P. Additional monitoring will be required to determine what the difference in duration of response is between the rates of P used and whether the higher rates can prove economical over time.

Crop nutrient decisions have traditionally been short-term decisions where the costs and benefits from applied fertiliser are realised within the same cropping season; in contrast deep-P placement is a longer-term decision  due to high upfront costs and the benefits lasting many seasons.

201638-4,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201638.pdf,The economics of deep placement of phosphorus in Queensland and northern NSW,However  subsoil P requirements are not so readily understood. Later season P has traditionally come from native subsoil P reserves  but as we deplete this P over years of cropping the need to introduce fertiliser sources to replenish these reserves is becoming more urgent  as stratification occurs. Nutrient stratification occurs when there is a redistribution of non-mobile nutrients such as P from the lower parts of the profile (10Ã¢ÂÂ30 cm) and then being released through stubble breakdown into the top 10 cm of the profile.

201604-29,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201604.pdf,Wheat: the effects of different planting dates on yield and plant physiology across different varietiesÃ¢ÂÂEmerald,Quicker varieties such as SuntopP  CondoP  LongReach SpitfireP and Elmore CL PlusP have the ability to flower quickly and still yield in a mid-April plant. Planting in mid-April  varieties will not suffer from heat stress as much and consequently tend to tiller more  increasing yield potential. By mid-May  the trials are showing that only a medium to quick variety should be considered unless a late July/early August frost is a significant concern.

Inherent genetic traits had more impact on protein  test weight and screenings than did changes in plant population. Background It is generally accepted that for dryland wheat planting in usual Queensland conditions  1 000 000 plants per hectare or 100 plants/m2 is optimal.

201611-2,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201611.pdf,Wheat: impact of population effect on the phenology and yield potentialÃ¢ÂÂBrookstead,If so  are there any clear varietal differences which can be used to optimise yield potential? Key findings 1. Yield increased with increasing plant population to approximately 1 million plants per hectare or 100 plants/m2 (there is some variation between varieties).
201611-13,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201611.pdf,Wheat: impact of population effect on the phenology and yield potentialÃ¢ÂÂBrookstead,As population increased from 25 to 75 plants/m2  the yield steadily increased. Between 100 and 150 plants/m2 the yield tends to be reasonable stable. Above 150 plants/m2 the yield appears to reduce a little  however further assessment of populations above 150 plants/m2 would be required to confirm this result (Figure 2).

The physical properties of residual herbicides varies by product (solubility  ultraviolet stability  stubble  soil binding etc.) as such efficacy can be affected by the environment in which it is applied (soil type  rainfall  temperature and ground cover).
201614-22,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201614.pdf,Wheat: impact of varying nitrogen treatments across different varieties and maturitiesÃ¢ÂÂGoondiwindi,When this season delivered a long  cool and wet grain fill period  it allowed the plants to develop a strong root system to extract their required nitrogen from deep within the profile and realise that yield. The grain protein dilution effect (Figure 1) was consistent for all nitrogen rates applied in this trial. This equates to an average protein spread of 2% between the highest protein variety (LongReach SpitfireP) and the lowest protein variety (SuntopP) with a half-tonne per hectare yield penalty for the higher protein.
201614-23,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201614.pdf,Wheat: impact of varying nitrogen treatments across different varieties and maturitiesÃ¢ÂÂGoondiwindi,Therefore  when growing the high yielding varieties such as SuntopP and EGA GregoryP  it is important to ensure enough nitrogen is available to the crop to achieve high yields and proteins. However  if high grain protein is important then it may be beneficial to accept a slightly lower yield and grow a high protein achieving variety such as LongReach SpitfireP. In this trial there was no difference between the grain yield and protein of the 100% treatments applied either up front or split between pre-plant and in-crop applications. This allows a strategy of applying nitrogen fertiliser for an average yield potential  then applying additional nitrogen in the vegetative period of the crop  as in-crop rain increases the cropÃ¢ÂÂs yield potential.

201614-13,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/201614.pdf,Wheat: impact of varying nitrogen treatments across different varieties and maturitiesÃ¢ÂÂGoondiwindi,This was possible because of a bulge of nitrogen below the budgeting depth  with 125 kg N/ha  in the 90-150 cm zone. The paddock nitrogen levels were higher than required for the 50% yield potential treatments  Grain quality (screenings  test weight and seed size) were not affected by any of the nitrogen treatments. The top yielding varieties in this trial were SuntopP  followed by EGA GregoryP and LongReach LancerP. For SuntopP and EGA GregoryP  the additional 100 kg N/ha in 150% YP was required to achieve the protein for the APH grade.

When comparing the nitrogen removal rates it is evident that for four of the varieties  the protein differences is a dilution effect from increasing yield. LongReach LancerP is the only variety to vary from this trend  producing higher protein for its relative yield (Table 2  Figure 1).

Background Recent research (UQ63) shows that grain yield can be reliably increased with deep- placed phosphorus (P)  particularly for cereal grain crops due to greater uptake of P by plants. However  this research was all done on 0.5 m fertiliser band spacing and granular monoammonium phosphate (MAP).

Targeting nitrogen levels which meet a 100% YP can ensure that the crop reaches its yield and grain protein potential and limits losses through screenings. Excessive nitrogen levels can reduce yield  increase screening and reduce test weights  while low nitrogen levels restrict yield and grain protein levels.

This needs to be confirmed by collecting further data from this site over a number of cropping years with different seasonal scenarios.

Our results showed the advantage of a mixed cropping system of vetch and barley over sole cropping under rainfed conditions in terms of dry matter production  total nitrogen content  and land use efficiency expressed as land equivalent ratio (LER). This advantage was more pronounced in the plants harvested once at the end of the season than those subjected to the three successive harvests.

Nitrogen fixation in vetch measured by the 15N-isotope dilution method  varied with the number of harvests and with cropping system. The percentage of N derived from the atmosphere (%'Ndfa) of vetch in mixed culture was in most cases higher than in monoculture.

Nevertheless  LER was 1.31 in the second growing season indicating that 31% more land is needed when sole cropped  compared to both crops being mixed. The LER values estimated for plants harvested once at the end of the experiment were even higher  1.99 and 1.53 for the first and the second season  respectively  reflecting a greater advantage of mixed cropping system in terms of land use efficiency.

The proportion of N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) as calculated from 15N dilution measurements varied among the different harvests and the cropping system adopted. Mixed cropping increased the fractional contribution of fixed N in vetch.

Overall  our results indicate the importance of mixed cropping system of vetch and barley  in terms of herbage yield  over sole cropping. The land equivalent ratio  LER  is the most frequently used index to determine the effectiveness of mixed cropping relative to monoculture (Mead and Willey  1980).

Total N yield Nitrogen content in herbage varied among harvests and species  and was influenced by the type of cropping system. Total N yield in pure vetch was higher than that in pure barley at each harvest in both seasons (Table 1).

The %Ndfa declined for sole vetch or vetch in the mixture for both seasons. The high dry matter production of the second harvest in S 1 for sole vetch and for vetch in the mixture  compared to that of the first harvest  increased the amount of Ndfa in the second harvest of the S 1.

Moreover  the total amount of fixed N for all harvests estimated in $2 were closer (in mixed vetch) or even higher (in pure vetch) than those fixed in plants harvested once at physiological maturity. However  the sum of N2 fixed in the three harvests in S1 was lower than that of plants harvested once at the end of the season.

Dry matter yield Total above ground dry matter accumulation varied with cropping pattern and with time as well as the number of harvests. For S 1  a pure stand of barley yielded more herbage than those of mixed stand (total vetch and barley) or the pure stand of vetch at the first and the third harvest.

Consequently  drought stress affects the ABA content in sugar-beet leaves in two different ways: moderate drought stress as in described pot experiments and field trials with a slow decrease of the water potential in soil to Ã¢ÂÂ0.05 and Ã¢ÂÂ0.2 MPa  respectively  induces an increase of both free and conjugated ABA in fully developed leaves of intact plants.

The most significant outcome was that the ranking of systems based on total GM rarely changed when using either the 10-year median commodity price or the average price over the last 3 years (2015 to 2017). Therefore  maximising long-term farming system productivity and resilience is more important than responding to current commodity prices.

Moreover  the project has measured yield benefits beyond what can be explained by the extra PAW.

In this situation stubble loads were of little consequence; any effect extra stubble had on slowing the evaporation of surface moisture had dissipated by the time the next rain fell.

The Mid and Late-terminated cover crops had drier soil surface when the site received 73 mm rain in March  which allowed them to capture more of this rainfall and so return a higher post-cover crop fallow efficiency; however  they still had the least PAW when the subsequent wheat crop was planted.

However  all cover crops treatments had improved capture of the overhead irrigation water in early crop development that led to significant cotton yield benefits. This current report is on research to explore the possibility of improving ground cover in a short fallow following a chickpea crop  without sacrificing the following wheat crop.
20192028-7,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/20192028.pdf,Cover crops: Summer cover crops on a short fallow reduced soil water and wheat yieldâBilla Billa,The 'Cover crop project' (DAQ00211) has monitored sites intensively to quantify the impact of different stubble loads on the accumulation of rainfall  the amount of water required to grow cover crops with sufficient stubble loads  the net water gains/losses for the following crops  and the impacts on their growth and yield. This project has previously demonstrated at Bungunya that it is possible to recoup PAW used by a cover crop in a long fallow between sorghum and wheat  and even increase total water storage in some treatments. Reported in Queensland grains research 2018-19  the trial subsequently established a more even wheat population after cover crops  extracted more water at harvest  and increased wheat grain yield by 30%.

However  the mid-terminated cereal maintained over 50% cover  which presumably led to it accumulating more moisture throughout the early stages of the following cotton.

However  the Control with limited ground cover was the poorest performer with at least 2.6 bales/ha lower yield  lower infiltration in early growth stages  and less water extracted late in the crop than treatments with cover crops. The costs to plant the cover crops (~$50/ha) and to spray them out (~$20/ha) almost matched the savings from three less weed sprays during the fallow (~$60).

There also appears to have been greater water extraction in some cover crop treatments in this Yelarbon experiment. While wheat establishment was dramatically better after cover crops at Bungunya  the trial planter configuration and the alignment of plots in the paddock at Yelarbon led to the cotton rows crossing over rows of cover crop stubble  making establishment hard to assess.

It is expected that the benefits of higher rates of P will become more pronounced the longer the site is cropped.

Background The University of Queensland and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries established trial sites across Queensland and northern New South Wales from summer 2011 onwards (Figure 1)  with the first crops harvested in 2013. Sites were initially treated with background levels of nitrogen (N) and zinc (Zn)  with potassium (K) and sulfur (S) applied where required in order to ensure that the sites were unconstrained by other nutrients.

This is further supported by the significantly higher chickpea response in 2017  and the much higher sorghum response in year 5 following the application of additional N (Table 5). Table 5.

150703-158,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/150703.pdf,Informed carbon strategies on mixed farms: practices and carbon compared,For example  commercial manure applications  use of forage crops and the introduction of pulse crops were not discernibly different in the paired site comparisons in the project. The comparison of modern agronomy with zero tillage (better stubble retention) and high nutrient applications suggests that these practices may make some contribution to slowing the decline in soil organic carbon in these cropping systems. Any effects are most likely to be small and to be from the better crop with higher grain and dry matter production  and the increased crop intensity that can be achieved with a zero tillage systems that store more moisture.
150703-185,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/150703.pdf,Informed carbon strategies on mixed farms: practices and carbon compared,However  changes in soil carbon are expected to take at least five years to accrue and were not measurable in the short term of this project. Subsequent monitoring over the coming years will estimate the impacts on total soil carbon stocks. IMPLICATIONS It is clear that long-term cropping depletes soil organic carbon and that changes are driven by the lengthy fallow periods in northern grain cropping systems.
150703-127,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/150703.pdf,Informed carbon strategies on mixed farms: practices and carbon compared,The initial carbon stocks in the soil were low  but were typical of a long-term cropping soil in the open grasslands of the western farming areas in the northern grain region. The Total Organic Carbon (0-10 cm) of 0.61% represents a significant decline from the native levels of 1.0-1.2%. The Total Organic Carbon appears to have declined in the top 10 cm over the prolonged fallow  although the result was not statistically significant.
150703-107,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/150703.pdf,Informed carbon strategies on mixed farms: practices and carbon compared,While the data suggest there may be a small impact of modern practices on maintaining soil carbon levels (Figure 16)  this comparison requires further investigation with more rigorous experimental methods. Overall  the project comparisons suggest that mixed farmers have much greater potential to rebuild and manage their soil organic matter and carbon levels that grain-only farmers. For most grain producers  this translated to strategies that focused on using the best possible agronomy to grow the best crops they could as often as possible.

This insight on the importance of soil phosphorus had a major impact on the participants in the project. Indeed  it was the catalyst for many of the mixed farmers developing strategies to maintain soil phosphorus levels on their cropping country.

The declines are most severe on the âscrubâ soil (e.g. brigalow clays) where declines in Total organic carbon levels (0-10cm) of 1-2% are common and may represent a loss of nutrient capital of up to $5000-8000/ha; â¢

3847-10,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/3847.pdf,Increasing farm water use efficiency in central west New South Wales,This is achieved through the adoption of practices targeting maximum fallow efficiency. The critical drivers to maximise fallow efficiency have been identified as maintaining at least 70% groundcover during the fallow if sheep are grazing stubbles  and maintaining a zero tolerance to weeds starting 10 days after each significant rainfall event during the fallow. It is possible to quantify the WUE of commercial crops and for a grower to easily benchmark WUE performance against other crops in the district.
3847-4,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/3847.pdf,Increasing farm water use efficiency in central west New South Wales,Modelling from CSIRO and CWFS research trials clearly shows fallow management to maximise stored soil moisture as a major driver of final yield and WUE. Easily adopted fallow management practices of zero tolerance to weeds in fallows  grazing sheep on fallows maintaining at least 70% of groundcover and timely sowing  provide opportunities for growers to maximise WUE. This message was extended across a wide geographical area  as well as nationally  through the 'Rain n Grain' branding.
3847-32,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/3847.pdf,Increasing farm water use efficiency in central west New South Wales,The importance of fallowing for successful crop production in the region has long been recognised by local growers  but the critical drivers for maximising stored soil water were not well understood in the no-till and minimum till farming systems. Research commissioned by CWFS and undertaken by NSW DPI quantified two important issues to maximise fallow efficiency regarding grazing sheep on stubbles and timing of weed control in relation to rainfall events. The take home messages from the grazing research is that provided weeds are controlled and that sheep do not eat them and a minimum of 70% groundcover of stubble is maintained then  in most years  there will be minimal impact on subsequent crop performance.

Thus it is necessary to further define the theoretical relationship between ammonium consumption and gross nitrification measured by independently labelled forms (15NH4 or 15NO3). In contrast to gross mineralization  gross nitrification rate in conventional tillage soil was lower than in reduced or no-till at four of seven sampling dates  which did not entirely support the first hypothesis that gross mineralizationâconsumption turnover rates will be lower in long-term no-till soils.

1377-5,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/1377.pdf,Chemistry and crop agronomy in alkaline cropping soils,Low calcium (Ca) in soils with pH greater than 9.0 leads to Ca deficiency. Acidification to reduce pH below 9.0 can be reasonably achieved by growing legumes and the simultaneous application of gypsum. This can also increase yield by 10% to 30% providing economic benefits to farmers.
1377-4,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/1377.pdf,Chemistry and crop agronomy in alkaline cropping soils,More than 30% reduction in grain productivity occurs when the pH is above 9.0. Above this pH  negative species of aluminium and carbonates become toxic to crops. Low flocculating power of magnesium (Mg)  prevalent in alkaline soils  can reduce soil structural stability.
1377-20,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/1377.pdf,Chemistry and crop agronomy in alkaline cropping soils,The benefits will be in terms of increase in grain production and farm profit. Economic outcomes Alkaline pH in many of the soils in the grain growing regions occurs mostly in subsoils. Observations in field trials and also in pot experiments have shown more than 30% reduction in crop yields when the pH is above 9.0.
1377-18,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/1377.pdf,Chemistry and crop agronomy in alkaline cropping soils,Amelioration of alkalinity by reducing soil pH below 9.0 is economical and practicable by growing legumes and a simultaneous application of gypsum. Recommendations Reducing the soil pH below 9.0 enhances crop productivity in alkaline soils by avoiding the toxicity of aluminium and carbonates  nutrient deficiency and other possible microelement toxicity. Because of low buffering intensity of alkaline soils in the pH range 10 and 8.0  acidification needs through amendments can be reasonably met.
1377-11,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/1377.pdf,Chemistry and crop agronomy in alkaline cropping soils,Field observations and pot trials conclude that when soil pH is above 9.0  crop yields are reduced by more than 30%.

Reclamation of alkalinity in Australian soils will increase crop production ranging from 10% to 30%. Alkaline soils occupy 23.8% of the total land area and hence the economic benefits are estimated to be in the vicinity of $900 million per year.

Thus gypsum improves soil structure and Ca nutrition in alkaline soils  particularly when the soil pH is more than 9.0. Economic evaluation of managing alkaline soils (Aim 3): The application of gypsum and growing legumes were found to be the most efficient and practicable means of amelioration of high soil pH among currently available options.

Pot experiments using artificial soil containing no aluminium have shown that in addition to the carbonate toxicity  aluminium (Al) is toxic to plants when the pH is above 9.0.
1377-14,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/1377.pdf,Chemistry and crop agronomy in alkaline cropping soils,To sustain this pH reduction and to prevent re-adsorption of carbonates from calcite minerals usually present in alkaline soils  removal of exchangeable sodium is necessary. 5.

525-10,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/525.pdf,Harvest technology for quality grain,Their effectiveness was shown to be highest with round snails but significantly reduced with conical snails. Many options generated considerable crop losses (with use of the 1420 IH harvester) and/or reduced harvester throughput as a drawback. Two basic approaches were tested:

Fitting a single pusher bar to an open front reduced grain sample contamination by an average 26%  33% and 27% in faba beans  barley and wheat  respectively (with an extra 18% reduction under dual pusher bar systems). Rotary brush concept A rotary brush unit fitted ahead of the front reel was developed as part of the project to provide adjustable snail dislodging in a wide range of crop/snail conditions.
525-19,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/525.pdf,Harvest technology for quality grain,Recommendations When the likelihood of meeting grain receival standards is high  investment in new equipment and machinery is expected to be economically justified. However  due to the grain loss and/or harvester throughput drawbacks associated with many snail management solutions  the overall approach recommended to grain growers is: i) Do not actively rely on harvest options as a snail management strategy  but ii) Develop awareness of the harvest technologies most able to assist with on-farm problem crops and  iii) Only use these available options as a last resort if and when previous opportunities for snail control have failed.
525-53,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/525.pdf,Harvest technology for quality grain,Field peas case study: Conventional open front with crop lifters generated the highest crop losses (up to 0.24t/ha). Significant reductions in snail intake (e.g. 40-80%) and lower crop losses (e.g. 0.08t/ha) were measured with open raking pickup technology  lowering snail gum accumulation rates and reducing snail contamination levels in the grain sample.
525-11,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/525.pdf,Harvest technology for quality grain,i) Minimising the intake of snails into the harvester with the use of dislodger bars did not always result in significant improvements in grain sample quality. However  it greatly reduced practical problems associated with snail gum accumulating within the harvester. A rotary brush concept was developed as part of the project that provided a versatile and effective snail dislodging solution for a wide range of crop conditions.
525-57,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/525.pdf,Harvest technology for quality grain,Under moderate round snail infestations  growers are likely to meet silo receival standards by combining fixed aperture sieve with improved front technologies. When facing high infestation of conical snails  the additional use of auger screens will achieve the lowest contamination levels in the grain sample  but is unlikely to meet receival standards. Stripper front performance Twenty five percent higher work rates and receival quality grain samples were reliably achieved in standing wheat crops using a stripper front +pusher bar  due to less crop material entering the harvester and a reduced likelihood of snail intake.
525-44,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/525.pdf,Harvest technology for quality grain,Auger screen option for large seeds Adding a fixed aperture screen under cross augers removed significant numbers of conical and round snails. Screening rates of up to 130 snails/s were measured under main cross auger in heavily infested faba beans  with low grain leakage (0.2-0.5%  mostly shrivelled/split grain). The data suggest that in a given snail/crop context  the snail screening capacity is a function of the total snail flow rate  and is influenced by screen size and type.
525-25,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/525.pdf,Harvest technology for quality grain,These solutions reduce downtime considerably  minimise harvester damage  as well as reduce uncertainty and farmer stress levels during harvest. In addition  fixed aperture sieves were optimised by crop type and shown to very significantly improve round snail separation performance  particularly in small size grain crops (canola  cereals). When harvesting larger seeds  these novel sieve options can be combined with auger screens  to reduce snail contaminants in grain (especially conical snails) and meet receival standards in specific cases.

Efforts can then be made to protect uninfested areas by cleaning farm machinery and limiting water run-off from infested areas to uninfested areas in infected fields. Identifying nematodes to a species level and determining the population size is necessary for correct crop and variety choice.
1082-22,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/1082.pdf,Cropping options to limit root-lesion nematodes,When these resistant crops are grown in rotation with wheat  yields and profit margins can be increased considerably. Environmental benefits Management of RLN requires an integrated approach involving careful selection of resistant crops to reduce populations  choosing tolerant crops that will yield well despite the presence of RLN and preventing spread of the nematodes to uninfested paddocks by cleaning machinery and controlling water run-off from infested to uninfested areas. These strategies offer sound  environmentally benign tools for growers.
1082-10,http://agask.uqcloud.net/agotatorapi/resources/1082.pdf,Cropping options to limit root-lesion nematodes,The outcomes provide economic gains in terms of increased yields and are environmentally benign. Crop losses due to RLN can be minimised by keeping nematode populations at low levels. This can be achieved by careful selection of resistant rotation crops and growing tolerant varieties of susceptible crops such as wheat and chickpea.

As these soils have a low water holding capacity  later removal would reduce the likelihood of nitrate leaching while retaining a good chance of filling the soil profile. On heavier clay soils with a high water holding capacity and resultant slow water movement in the soil profile (low chance of nitrate leaching)  early removal is highly recommended.

Removal of pasture in spring will result in higher soil nitrate at sowing compared to removal in summer. Early removal also allows more time for fallow recharge.
